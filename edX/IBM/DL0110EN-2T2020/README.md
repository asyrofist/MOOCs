According to the description presented in the web site:

> The course will teach you how to develop Deep Learning models using Pytorch while providing the necessary deep-learning background.
> 
> We'll start off with PyTorch's tensors and its Automatic Differentiation package. Then we'll cover different Deep Learning models in each section, beginning with fundamentals such as Linear Regression and logistic/softmax regression.
We'll then move on to Feedforward deep neural networks, the role of different activation functions, normalization and dropout layers.
> 
> In the final part of the course, we'll focus on Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning (pre-trained models). Several other Deep Learning methods will also be covered..


## What you'll learn
- Explain and apply knowledge of Deep Neural Networks and related machine learning methods;
- Know how to use Python, and Python libraries such as Numpy and Pandas along with the PyTorch library for Deep Learning applications;
- Build Deep Neural Networks using PyTorch.


In this course, you will learn how to build deep neural networks in PyTorch. Also, you will learn how to train these models using state of the art methods. You will first review multiclass classification, learning how to build and train a multiclass linear classifier in PyTorch. This will be followed by an in-depth introduction on how to construct Feed-forward neural networks in PyTorch, learning how to train these models, how to adjust hyperparameters such as activation functions and the number of neurons.

You will then learn how to build and train deep neural networksâ€”learning how to apply methods such as dropout, initialization, different types of optimizers and batch normalization. We will then focus on Convolutional Neural Networks, training your model on a GPU and Transfer Learning (pre-trained models). You will finally learn about dimensionality reduction and autoencoders. Including principal component analysis, data whitening, shallow autoencoders, deep autoencoders, transfer learning with autoencoders, and autoencoder applications.
