    "This is a fine way of defining both the person class and the stream class. However, there is a much easier in more concise way of actually doing this using something called **inheritance**. The idea of inheritance is that you can define classes that inherit from other classes. So, in other words, they take all of the instance variables, all of the methods that that other class has, and then they can add more instance variables and more methods. So, in this case, every *student* is a *person*. It's not true that necessarily every person is a student, but every student is a person. \n",

So I'll say that every student is a person. Now that I do this I can get rid of some of the repetitive parts of the student class. So, for example `getAge()`, is a little bit repetitive. I don't need it in both student and person because it is already inside of person. So I'm going to remove `getAge()` from the `Student` class. I'm going to do the same for the `__ str__()` method. Also, `self.name` and `self.year_born` is a little bit repetitive with the `Person` class. So in the constructor for the student, I'm going to say that I want to call the constructor of `Person`, passing the name and the year to the class `Person`. Now, when I do this I'm going to call this init method, or the Person constructor, on this new student. So this is going to call this method.

    "We've already covered inheritance, but it's worth talking about when we actually want to inherit and how we want to inherit at times. So, in general, the way that Python uses inheritance is that let's suppose that we have a superclass, where the superclass is the class that we're inheriting from. Let's suppose that we have a subclass, which inherits from the superclass. We also have instances. Let's suppose that we have instances of the subclass. Now, whenever Python is looking for any method or instance variables, it's always first going to look inside of the instance, and it's going to ask does the instance have that thing? If it doesn't, then it's going to look inside of that instances class and it's going to ask does that instances class have that instance variable or method? If it doesn't, then it's then going to look into the superclass. In Python, that's just how superclasses work. By adding this extra layer of looking at the superclass for things that are missing in the subclass, what we do is we inherit everything that the superclass has and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, this gets to the question of, \"When should we actually inherit from a superclass?\" Well, you should only inherit if your subclass should have absolutely everything that the superclass has, plus more or maybe plus some small modification. So, let's go over an example of this. So, let's suppose that I want to represent books in the library, and let's suppose that we have two kinds of books. We have paper books and we have ebooks. So, the way that I would represent that in classes, is I would have one superclass for book. So, I'd say that for class book, every book is going to have a title and an author. Let's suppose that we have this `__str__` method as well, and we're going to return title by author."

By default every pet has sounds list of `['Mrrp']`. You'll see that the `Bird` class has a class variable sounds set to `['chirp']`. Thus, when I call `Pet.__init__()`, it sets `self.sounds` as a copy of `sounds`, but as `self` is an instance of `Bird`, it's going to create a copy of this list of sounds, and so `b1.sounds` ends up being `chirp`. So again, when Python is searching for `b1.sounds`, it first searches inside of the instance. This instance does it have sounds instance variable yet, and then it searches inside of that instances class, and so we find `chirp`, or a list that only contains `chirp` as the list of sounds. So, here we end up creating a copy of that."
