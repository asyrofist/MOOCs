In fact, classes are so nice that some programming languages like Java, require you to use classes in order to use the language at all. Python makes classes optional, they can make your code much easier to read and write. \n",

If it doesn't pass, you know you did something wrong with the function."

    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language. That means it provides features that support object-oriented programming (OOP). **Object-oriented programming** has its roots in the 1960s, but it wasn’t until the mid 1980s that it became the main programming paradigm used in the creation of new software. It was developed as a way to handle the rapidly increasing size and complexity of software systems and to make it easier to modify these large and complex systems over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now, some of the programs we have been writing use a procedural programming paradigm. In procedural programming the focus is on writing functions or *procedures* which operate on data. In object-oriented programming the focus is on the creation of objects which contain both data and functionality together. Usually, each object definition corresponds to some object or concept in the real world and the functions that operate on that object correspond to the ways real-world objects interact."

    "\n",
    "In Python, every value is actually an object. Whether it be a dictionary, a list, or even an integer, they are all objects. Programs manipulate those objects either by performing computation with them or by asking them to perform methods. To be more specific, we say that an object has a **state** and a collection of **methods** that it can perform. (More about methods below.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The **state of an object** represents those things that the object knows about itself. The state is stored in instance variables. For example, as we have seen with turtle objects, each turtle has a state consisting of the turtle’s position, its color, its heading and so on. Each turtle also has the ability to go forward, backward, or turn right or left. Individual turtles are different in that even though they are all turtles, they differ in the specific values of the individual state attributes (maybe they are in a different location or have a different heading)."

    "# User-Defined Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are a nice and convenient way to represent data because they bundle the data and associated functions or methods that we care about into one object. So let's suppose that we wanted to create Python objects to represent a point. And when I say a point what I mean is that we have $x$ and $y$, and along the scale, we might have a point. So this point, for example, might be at $x=10$, $y=2$. You might have this point, at $x=8$, $y=-3$, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's create a Python class to represent points. So the way that we create a class is we write the keyword `class`, and then we give the class a name. So I'm going to call this class `Point`. Now, what we did is we said we want to create a new class with this class keyword. Convention is that we always start class names with the capital letter, so that's why I'm calling this `Point`. Inside the class we have the body of the class. Before I fill out this class what I'm going to do is I'm going to create what are called *Instances*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a kind of a factory, instances are the things that that factory produces. So in this case, the `Point` class is like a factory for creating new points. The way that I create an instance of point is I'm going to say something like `point1 = Point()`. I can say, `point2 = Point()` as well. So what I've done here is, I've created two instances, `point1` and `point2`. And now, even though this looks a lot like calling a function, because I have the name of the class, and then opening and closing parentheses. This is actually doing something slightly different than calling the function. It's instead creating an instance of this point class, where `point1` and `point2` are different instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we can do with an instance, is we can set whats called an **Instance Variable**. An instance variable is a variable that kind of lives inside of an instance. So if I say `point1.x = 5`, and `point2.x = 10`. Then these are setting instance variables called $x$ for `point1` and `point2`. Now, if I print out `point1.x`, then I'm going to get $5$. If I print out `point2.x`, then I'm going to get $10$."

For example, `__init__()` accepts three arguments, it accepts `self` and it accepts arguments for `x` and `y`. So, this method, the constructor `__init__()`, lives inside of the class.

In every instance has a set of instance variables, in this case the instance variables are `x`, which we set to 10 and `y`, which we set to 100. When Python evaluates this statement `Point(10, 100)`, what it does is it first creates a new kind of blank instance that doesn't have any instance variables at first. The next thing that Python does is it asks, does this point class have a constructor or in other words this underscore init method? In the case of `Point` there is an `__init__` method. So, what Python does is it calls that method on this empty instance. What it's going to do is it's going to take this instance and pass it in as the value for `self` when we call the constructor. In all of this is done before we even have finished evaluating this statement. So, we take this instance in and that's the value of `self` and then in this case we're also passing in two additional arguments. We're passing in `10` for `x` and `100` for `y`. When we're passing in values for `x` and `y` these are just function arguments. When we set `self.x = x`, what that does is it sets the instance variable for this instance. So, it's setting the instance variable `x` to whatever this value `x` that we passed in it. So, in this case we passed in `10` for `x`. So, we're setting the instance variable for this instance `x` to `10`. Same thing for `y`. In this case we're setting `y to the value `100` because that was what was passed in.\n"

    "You've already learned that functions and methods can return any kind of value as their return value. But one thing that's worth noting is that they can specifically return other instances. So let's suppose that we have this Point class. And this Point class has a constructor, and the constructor sets two instance variables for `x` and `y`. And we have methods `getX()` to return the `x` instance variable, `getY()` to return the `y` instance variable. \n",

So for example, here I have point `p`, and I have point `q`, and let's say that we wanted a function that would return a new point that was halfway between point `p` and point `q`. And let's call that function `halfway`, and let's make it a method on every point. So for example, if I say `p.halfway(q)`, then this should return a new Point that is halfway between `p` and `q`. In our example, the `x` should be halfway between `3` and `5`, so the `x` should be `4`. And the `y` should be halfway between `4` and `12`, so the `y` should be `8`. "

Now remember that `key` in `sort` is expecting a function as it's argument, so what I want to pass into key is a function that tells us what we want to sort by.

If it doesn't find an instance variable with the name, then it searches inside of the class. When we say `p2.graph`, Python first searches inside of `p2`, it doesn't find it there and so it searches inside of the point class where it finds it. \n",

It would then search inside the `Point` class, it wouldn't find `z` there either and so it would give us a run-time error. Now, the way that we define this point class, is that we have this graph method and what graph does is a kind of forms a text graph or a textual representation of a graph that contains this point. Inside of this representation of graph, I refer to `self.printed_rep`. So you'll note that here, `printed_rep` again is a class variable that's set to a `*`. If I change `printed_rep` to be let's say a lowercase `x`, then you'll see that `printed_rep` changes for both `p1` and `p2` when we actually called the graph method on both of them. So, that's an example of how classes can contain variables. So again, we have instance variables that belong to every particular instance and we have class variables which belong to a class. Here technically, there are three class variables, there's `printed_rep`, `__init__` and `graph` that all belong to the point class."

    "- Then, once you know that, then you should ask yourself, what does one particular instance represent of this class? So if it's a list of songs, one particular instance might represent a song. One particular instance of a list of students might represent one particular student. \n",
    "- Then from there you should ask yourself, what are the instance variables? What's unique to every instance that I might have? So if it's a list of students, it might be something like a name, a student ID. If it's a list of songs, it might be the artist, the track name, the length, et cetera. \n",
    "- Then after you know that you should also ask, what methods might you actually want? So, if every instance is a particular song, then you might have a method, for example, to paying an external API to get the lyrics for that song. If it's a student, you might want to have a method to, for example, send a message to that student. It depends again on what your instances represent. \n",
    "- Then finally, you should ask yourself, what does the printed representation of an instance look like? So if I print out a particular song, then I might want to print out the track name, and then the album name, and maybe the length. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should have answers to all of these questions before you start writing code for classes. Now, it's important to know that designing classes is really more of an art than a science. It's very common to also refactor or rewrite classes in instance variables and methods even for experts. But all of this comes more with practice."
