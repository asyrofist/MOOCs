    "Remember that there are three main kinds of errors that we can get when writing Python code. \n",
    "- **Syntactic errors:** that's when Python doesn't understand how to read the instructions in your program. So, for example, if I forget a bracket or a parenthesis and I tried to run my program, then I get a syntax error saying that Python didn't understand the instructions that I gave it. \n",
    "- **Runtime errors:**: that occurs when Python understood the instructions that I gave it, but something went wrong when Python tried to run those instructions. So, for example, if I run a code to access the index greater than the size of the array, I get a runtime error or more specifically an index error because even though Python understands that I'm creating a list and assigning that list to items and then I'm assigning third to be the third item in items, because item only has two items. When I tried to fetch index two, then I get an index error which is the kind of runtime error. So, in other words, Python understood what I wanted to do, but something went wrong as Python was trying to execute my code.\n",
    "- **Semantic errors:** this is when Python successfully ran the code, it just wasn't exactly what I wanted it to do. So, for example, if I wrote a function to add two numbers and that function actually divided two numbers, Python isn't going to give me an error but I'm also not going to be happy when my code divides the numbers that I wanted to add. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we have a **syntactic error**, Python doesn't run our code at all. When we have a **runtime error**, Python runs our code until it encounters the runtime error. Then we have a **semantic error**, Python runs our code but it just doesn't end up being what we wanted it to be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually when we encounter a **runtime error**, then Python is going to stop running our code as soon as we encounter the runtime error. So, for example, the code below gives us an index error. So, let's suppose that run my code, you'll notice that the line with the \"this is not going to be reached\" message doesn't print out because this expression results in a runtime error. So, again, when you get a runtime error right here, then our program just stops running and throws in this case an index error. \n"

So, let's suppose that we were extracting data from some dictionary `d` that we got using some Internet API. We need to handle the case where some key might be missing from `d`. So, we might write that by saying if that key is in `d`, then we extract the data properly. If that key isn't in `d`, we skip that one. Alternative way of doing that is we can say try extracting the data from `d` and then presumably, if some key isn't actually in the dictionary `d`, then we would get some run time exception. In this case, let's suppose that we get a key error and then if we get a key error, then we skip that particular item. Now, these are two ways of doing the exact same thing. One using `if` and `else`, the other using `try` and `except`. "

    "When is it right to use one versus the other? The answer unfortunately really depends. So, if you have just a few kinds of errors that you're going to easily be able to anticipate, then it's probably better to use an `if` and an `else`. Because `if`/`else` is more specific to whatever kind of error you're expecting. So, in this case, I'm expecting that some key might not be in my dictionary. That's more specific than saying if I get any key error. If I can't anticipate what might not be there and I just need to handle something going wrong, so in other words, I can't anticipate what might go wrong but I know that something might go wrong, then it's better to use a `try` and `except`. \n",

    "In general, when using a `try-except` or deciding whether to use an `if`/`else`, it's better to be as specific as possible. So, if it's one particular key that you know is either going to be there or not there, I'd use an `if`/`else`. If I don't know what might go wrong but I know that something might go wrong, so a dictionary might be in a different format than I'm expecting, then I might use a `try-except`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some exceptions to that rule. So, for example, let's suppose that I need to have an `if` and then I have a whole bunch of checks. So, let's say rather than having just some key, let's say that I have 10 different keys that I might want to check if those 10 different keys are in my dictionary, then I might choose to just use a `try-except` just because it's a little more concise rather than checking on all 10 of those keys. So, really, it comes down to how much can you anticipate, how tedious is it to write out all of the conditions that you might have to handle exceptions for, and really, it comes down to more of an art rather than a science."
