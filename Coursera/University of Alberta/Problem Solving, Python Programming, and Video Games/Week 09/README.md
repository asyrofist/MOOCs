# Module 8: Poke the Dots Version 1 & 2

In Module 8, you will design and implement Version 1 of a new graphical game called Poke the Dots. You will then modify your game design using data abstraction to create user-defined classes. You will learn two new Python statements (class definition, pass) that will allow you to construct your own Python types. You will employ these Python constructs to implement Poke the Dots Version 2.
