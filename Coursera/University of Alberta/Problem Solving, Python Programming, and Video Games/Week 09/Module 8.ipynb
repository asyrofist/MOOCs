    "## Introduction to Poke the Dots\n",
    "\n",
    "The first version of Poke the Dots focuses on a new technique called **event handling**. There are many categories of events in a game. These include *mouse clicks* and *key presses*. Event handling allows you to recognize these events, and react to them if necessary. To handle events, we use the graphics library `pygame`. We continue to use `uagame`, but also use some capabilities from `pygame` directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Observed game**: Let's take a look at the complete Poke the Dots game. When the window opens, there are two dots moving on the screen. When the dots hit the edge of the screen, they bounce. In the top left corner of the screen is a scoreboard that increases for every second that the game is running. When the dots collide, the game ends. To end the game, we have to press the close icon to close the window. The dots start in different places on the screen when the game is restarted. When clicking the left mouse button, the dots disappear from the screen and reappear in a random location. They do this every time the user clicks the mouse button. Finally, the red dot and and the blue dot move differently. The red dot moves faster in vertical direction, and the blue dot moves faster in the horizontal direction.\n",

    "## Create Algorithm for Poke the Dots Version 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In poke the dots, the dots move continuously within the window until they collide with each other. Like movies, games use the rapid transition of multiple still images to simulate movement. To do this, a program needs to draw its changing objects fast enough that the human eye doesn't detect that it is looking at still images. In poke the dots, the game must update based on both player actions such as mouse clicks, and game conditions such as dots hitting an edge of the window, and the time changing. Waiting for prompted player input before updating the window is different than responding to unprompted player actions that occur whenever the player feels like it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, the prompt determines when the player is allowed to act, and the program just waits for the specific action. In the second case, the program must continuously check for player actions while still animating the game objects. Both continuous animation and handling player actions will be addressed by a *frame loop*. A *frame loop* is a control structure in a program that update the game objects and redraws the game window contents repeatedly to simulate motion. A frame is one still image that contains all the objects that should be displayed. Each time through the frame loop the program must also check whether the player has taken any actions, and respond appropriately. Since poke the dots will run at 90 frames per second, for every second of game time there will be 90 still images drawn to the window. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the algorithm, we `create window` step, `create game`, `play game` which will contain the frame loop, and `close window`. Every game you create can use the same four steps. Different games can be created by varying the substeps of `create game` and `play game`. This is an example of the using *templates problem-solving* technique. We can use these four solution steps as a foundation for any game we create. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expand `create game` and add a step to create the clock, since the clock is responsible for the speed or frame rate of the game. Since this game has two dots, we have a step to create a small dot and a big dot. We create the dot attributes such as location, color, size, and velocity when writing the code for creating a dot. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Play game` is where we add the frame loop. We want the window to remain open until the close icon is clicked. We add `play frame` with three steps. The first is handle events which keeps track of any player actions. The second is draw game which draws the current frame. The last is update game which updates all the game objects for the next frame. The objects are updated after they are drawn, so their initial position is shown. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `draw game`, we add three steps. The first two steps are draw small dot and draw big dot. The final step of the `draw game` updates the window to display all objects that were just drawn. In poke, we can draw all the objects and then update the display once per frame. \n",
    "We expand `handle events` to lead with the game events. Every graphics library has a function that returns a sequence of events. The sequence includes all events that occurred since the last time the function was called. We will call this function once per frame and then use definite repetition to handle all the new events in the sequence. This version of poke the dots, we only handle one category of event which is clicking the close icon on the window. For each frame of poke the dots as long as player has selected close is false, the game plays the next frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expand `update game` to move the small dot and the big dot and control the frame rate. If the frame rate is not controlled, the game will run as fast as a computer's processing speed will allow, which will be different speeds for different machines. A circle is made of a large number of pixels to simulate a smooth curve on the screen. It would be ridiculous to represent a circle as a list of its pixels. Instead, we can represent a circle using two objects: it's center point and its radius. The radius can be a single integer, but the center point must be a sequence containing two integer coordinates ($x$, $y$). This representation requires less space to store. Using this representation, when the circle moves its radius stays the same and only its center changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each frame, a dot moves in both the $x$ and $y$-direction. It moves its velocity at index zero in the $x$-direction and its velocity at index one in the $y$-direction. A positive velocity means that the dot is moving to the right, or down. Since each velocity component is added to the corresponding coordinate of the dot center. A negative velocity means that the dot is moving to the left, or up. Since adding a negative velocity makes it smaller. We need to check if the dot moves outside the window. To bounce the dot from the window edge, we negate its velocity at the index whose location we are updating. If a dot is moving only to the right at positive two pixels per frame and hits the right edge, its velocity at index zero which is its velocity in the $x$-direction is negative. So, it becomes negative two pixels per frame. If a dot is moving only to the left at negative one pixels per frame and hits the left edge, its velocity at index zero which is its velocity in the $x$-direction is negative, so it becomes positive one pixels per frame. If a dot is moving only down at positive three pixels per frame and hits the bottom edge, its velocity at index one which is its velocity in the $y$-direction is negated, so it becomes negative three pixels per frame. Below we have the complete algorithm for the version 1 of Poke the Dots.\n",

    "## Python Import Statement Variations\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve *name conflicts* and import objects from submodules, which are modules inside of other modules we can use a variation of the import statement. A *name conflict* occurs when you try to use the same identifier to refer to different objects at the same time. For example, using the name `sleep` as a function from `time` or as an identifier to represent a string such as `sleep = 'Yes'`. You can resolve a name conflict by selecting a different identifier to bind to one of the conflicting objects, such as `sleep_day = 'Yes'`. However, we need to change `sleep` to `sleep_day` everywhere I want to refer to the string that was entered by the user. Python provides the versatility to resolve conflicts due to imported names using different variations of the import statement. These variations allow you to use the most appropriate local name in your program to represent each imported object. You were not constrained by the names used in other modules. Below, we have a generalization of the previous import statement that adds an optional `as` clause to provide an alternate local name for each imported name. This local name is often called an **alias**. \n",

    "\n",
    "The generalized semantics of the import statement becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the module name to find the module\n",
    "2. Evaluate the module's statement, which binds the name\n",
    "3. Dereference the imported identifiers in the module's namespace to find the objects they are bound to\n",
    "4. If any imported identifier (or alias if used) is not in the program's namespace, add it\n",
    "5. Bind the imported identifiers (or aliases if used) in the program's namespace to the module's object\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to the `from` import statement is the `non-from` variation. This variation has the syntax expressed in the image above and the semantics is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the module name to find the module\n",
    "2. Evaluate the module's statement, which binds its name\n",

    "A module inside another module is called a **submodule**. To import objects from a submodule, we generalize the syntax diagram for **module** itself as illustred in the image above. To access objects from a submodule, the syntax for module contains a sequence of identifiers separated by dots. For example, the standard library contains a module called `os`, which provides access to operating system functions and other objects. Inside the `os` module is a submodule called `path` that contains a function called `isfile`. The `isfile` function returns `true` if its string argument is the name of a file that exists in the folder that Python is run from, and `false` otherwise. This function can be called as:\n",

    "**Pass statement** serves as a place holder in a Python program. When one is writing code, he often write partial statements that will be complete later.

Although a pass statement can be used anywhere in a program that any other kind of statement can be used, it is most often used in the suite of a compound statement to prevent a syntax error. If you are writing a program with functions and you want to test the program before you have finished writing all the functions, you can use **functions stubs** that consists of function definitions whose suites are single-pass statements. For example, the banner function below is a function stubs:\n",

Since the dot move such a tiny amount in each frame, it gives the appearance of drawing a tail in the window. To fix this, we erase the previous dot before drawing the new one. We add a call to clear window at the beginning of the `draw_game()` function and run the program again. Everything works!\n",
