# Module 4: Hacking Version 3

In Module 4, you will modify your game design to support multiple gameplay paths using a new problem decomposition criteria called case-based decomposition, which utilizes a selection control structure. You will learn one new Python statement (if), one new Python expression (unary expression), and one new Python type (bool). You will employ these Python constructs to write, test, and debug Hacking Version 3.
