    "Version 3 of Hacking includes multiple paths through the game. The outcome of the game depends on player input. Adding the ability to select a game outcome based on the player's actions, requires a control structure. Recall that a control structure dictates when an algorithm step is performed, including whether it is performed at all. The **Selection** control structure is represented by a diamond in the diagram below and has two rectangles associated with it. The `true` rectangle contains the algorithm step that is performed if the condition in the diamond is `true`. Conversely, the `false` rectangle contains the algorithm step that is performed if the condition in the diamond is `false`. The condition you choose for the selection control structure, must always evaluate to `true` or `false`. There must always be an algorithm step in the `true` answer. However, there doesn't always have to be an algorithm step in the `false` answer. The new algorithm is as follows:\n",

A statement that includes another statement is called a **compound statement**. A statement that does not include another statement, is called a **simple statement**. The `if` statement is a **compound statement**, while the *expression*, *assignment* and *import* statements are **simple statements**. Below, we can see the syntax of the `if` statement.\n",

The statement following the suite must use the same indentation as the header line of the `if` statement that contains the suite. \n",

The `if` clause has a condition and a `suite` of statements. The `else` clause has a `suite` of statements but no explicit condition.

    "## Python Keyword Operator, Short Circuit Evaluation, and Unary Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we revise the syntax diagram for binary operator by adding the keyword operators that can be used as binary operators, illustred in the image below. Notice that in addition to `and`, `in`, `is` and `or`, there are two keyword operator pairs: `not in` and `is not`. They can each be used as a single binary operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rogergranada/MOOCs/master/Coursera/University%20of%20Alberta/Problem%20Solving%2C%20Python%20Programming%2C%20and%20Video%20Games/Week%2005/images/unary_expression.svg\" width=\"80%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Even adding these new binary operators, the semantic rule for binary expressions does not change. However, when using `AND` and `OR` operators, the operator function uses a technique called short-circuit evaluation, where the result object may not depend on the second operand. The semantics of the `AND` operator has the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the first operand is interpreted as false, the first operand is the result object\n",
    "2. Otherwise, evaluate the second expression as the result object\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if the first element of a `AND` comparion is interpreted as `False`, the second element is not evaluated. The  `AND` operator function has another interesting property. If the operand is the empty string, which is interpreted as `False` in an `if` statement condition, the `AND` operator function semantics interpret non-Boolean objects the same way. So, the empty string is interpreted as `False`, but, the empty string is the resulting object. The same occurs for zero or 0.0. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `OR` operator function also uses short-circuit semantics using the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the first operand is interpreted as true, the first operand is the result object\n",
    "2. Otherwise, evaluate the second expression as the result object\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if the first operand is interpreted as `True`, the first operand is the resulting object. Otherwise, evaluate the second expression as the result object. Notice that neither of the operator token `~` nor the keyword operator `not` can be used as a binary operator. Instead, both are unary operators that act on a single operand. The syntax diagram for a unary expression is also illustrated in the image above. The plus and minus operator tokens can be used either as binary or unary operators. The semantics of unary expressions is similar to the semantics of binary expressions, except that there is only one operand to evaluate, and has the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate the expression to get the operand object\n",
    "2. Identify the operator function using the operator and operand's type\n",
    "3. Apply the unary operator's function\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for applying the unary expression semantics to `-27`. In step one, the expression is the literal integer `27`, which evaluates to the int object `27`. In step two, the unary operator `-` and the type `int` are used to identify the numerical negation function, which reverses the sign of its integer operand object. In step three, the numerical negation function is applied to the `int` object `27` to obtain the `int` object `-27`. Notice that `-27` is not a literal integer. It is a unary expression that applies the minus operator to an integer object to obtain a result object. "

If the user does not enter an integer, output a warning message. For this question a valid integer consists of one or more digits (`0-9`) with an optional leading minus sign (`-`).\n",

To check whether this minus is followed by all digits you can use a method in the string class to create a new string that has all the minus characters stripped from it. However, this method may strip multiple minus signs from the string so you will also need to check if the stripped string has length, one less than the original string as well.<br>\n",
