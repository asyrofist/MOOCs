    "\n",
    "There's only one solution issue left from version four since nothing happens when the dots collide. For this version of poke the dots, we are going to detect when the dots collide and change the game behavior accordingly. We have already implemented some collision detection with regard to the edges of the window, which equations deal with one non-moving object (the window and one moving object). For this version, we have to investigate how to handle collision between two moving objects. "

    "In the final version of Poke the Dots nothing seems different from the previous version. The dots are red and blue, they move at the same speed as version four, and they bounce when they hit the edge of the window. The scoreboard is still white and tallies the number of seconds since the game was started. When we press the mouse button the dots teleport to random locations around the window. However, when the dots collide, the dots immediately stop and a **Game Over** message appears in a corner of the screen. Notice that the text has the color of the small dot and the background has the color of the big dot as in the example below.\n",

    "## Solution Issues in Poke the Dots Version 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is the last version of Poke the Dots, we only have one more task in the game creation process diagram to finish. Let's explore some of the potential solution issues that could be solved to improve Poke the Dots. Let's investigate some of the improvements that can be made to Poke the Dots. \n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** Poke the Dots is not a visually interesting game. One small modification would be making an addition to the mouse up event handler. Every time you click the mouse button, you could randomly change the colors of the dots.<br> \n",
    "**2.** Poke the Dots can be boring since it isn't very challenging. You could make the game more interesting by making it more challenging. Here are three ways to increase the difficulty to hopefully increase enjoyment. \n",
    "- Every time you press the mouse button, you could increase the speed of the dots. This would force the player to be very careful about when they press the mouse button, as pressing too often will make the dots very fast. \n",
    "- Although this game is called Poke the Dots, you can click anywhere in the window to teleport the dots. A more accurate and challenging rendition of the game could be created by modifying your mouse up event handler to only teleport if the mouse cursor is inside a dot when clicked. \n",
    "- Another way to increase the difficulty of Poke the Dots is to add a new dot whenever the mouse cursor is clicked outside of the dot. This idea works especially well if you include the feature of only teleporting the dots when the mouse is clicked inside the dot. Instead of doing nothing if the player clicks outside of the dot, you could add a punishment that every missed timed click adds a new dot with a random color and size to the screen. You might want to make the window a bit larger if you try this improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** Finally, we could make the game easier to replay, since currently, you must close the window and then restart the game. Alternately, you can add an additional event handler that checks if the game is over and a replay key is pressed. If so, the game can be restarted by setting continue game to true. However, you must figure out a way to reset the score to zero each time you do a restart. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are only a few of the many improvements that could be made to Poke the Dots."
