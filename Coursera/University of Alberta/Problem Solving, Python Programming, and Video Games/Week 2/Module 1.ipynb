    "## Algorithms for Computational Problem-Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational problem-solving, also called computational thinking, uses three kinds of techniques to solve problems: *problem decomposition*, *algorithms*, and *abstraction*. A process or **algorithm** is a sequence of actions that solves a problem or create something, which we call an artifact. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, there is a game creation process diagram, where each sub-task is a part of the computational problem. The first sub-task is **understand game**, where you need to understand what game you are trying to make, *i.e.*, knowing what happens, where it happens, when it happens, and why it happens. \n",

    "\n",
    "Understand game can be divided into two sub-tasks: *observe game* and *play game*. *Observe game* provides a broad but superficial knowledge of the problem, letting you to create an initial impression about that problem. *Play game* allows a deeper personal understanding of a problem by engaging with it. After playing the game, it is important to describe it to another person. Explaining the problem to others allows you to gain a deeper understanding of the problem in many different contexts."

    "## Observing Game\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step for problem solving is to observe the game while it is being played. From this observation, questions may be arised, such as \"how does it flow?\", \"How many attempts can the user do?\", etc. Below, we show the game being played. \n",

    "**Observations of the game**: The game asks the player to guess a password. There are a maximum of four guess attempts. The game checks the exact placement of letters in the guess against the secret password, and displays a hint. If you are successful, the game congratulates you. What else did you see? Can you think of a situation that didn't happen in the video but could happen in the game? For example, what happens when the player makes too many incorrect guesses? Now it is your turn to play the game. Play several times to gain a deeper understanding of hacking."

    "## Create Version\n",
    "\n",
    "The next task in the game creation process is **Create Version**. The circular arrow before *create version* indicates that you must do this task one or more times - indicating that the game is divided into many versions as needed. Each version solves a small problem, instead of trying to solve a big problem at once. To decide what each version will add to the game, we use a kind of problem decomposition called *Feature Selection*. Thus, each version of the game has its own features (e.g., the first version has few features such as show the list of passwords, or guess the correct password, while the subsequent versions adds a few more features until the last version that has the complete game), where the features for each version should require approximately the same amount of effort to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/rogergranada/MOOCs/master/Coursera/University%20of%20Alberta/Problem%20Solving%2C%20Python%20Programming%2C%20and%20Video%20Games/Week%202/images/create_game_2.svg\" width=\"80%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can divide the process of Create Version into subtasks as a problem refinement. Thus, we divide the *Create Version* task into three tasks: *Create Design*, *Create Program* and *Reflect*, where each subtask creates a problem solution that is more precise than the previous one. *Create Design* converts our understanding of the game into a precise algorithm representing the version of the game. *Create Program* converts the algorithm into a precise program, while *Reflect* assesses your knowledge of the programming language techniques you applied, evaluates your solution and identifies improvements for the next version.\n",
    "\n",
    "When in *Create Design*, we decompose this task into subtasks that are easier to solve. The division is composed into *Understand version*, *Create version test plan* and *Create algorithm*. *Understand version* is similar to the understand game task, where in *Observe game version* we see how the game works and *Play game version*, we play the game. The next step is *Create version description*, where we produce a written description of the game version that should explain what the game does including its features and player actions. The description is imprecise because it provides the goals of our implementation, but not the details of the implementation itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next task in *Create design* is *Create version test plan*, which creates a test plan that checks if the feature set is implemented correctly. This artifact is more precise than the game description because it more explicitly considers multiple gameplay scenarios. The description describes all possible outcomes but the tests prescribe which sequence of player actions result in which game outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, *Create algorithm* produces the most precise artifact of the design, which corresponds to a sequence of steps that prescribe how the code should be written. It is more precise than the tests since the algorithm is closer to the code, each step corresponds to a few lines of code. However, an algorithm should be independent of any specific programming language. So, an algorithm is less precise than the code that implements it."
