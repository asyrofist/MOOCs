An *Identifier* is analogous to a pronoun in natural language, since you'll discover that the same identifier can refer to different objects in different parts of a program.

    "*Reflection* is an important step in the game creation process, since learning a new skill usually involves a narrow focus on a specific situation. It is necessary to generalize the skills so it can be applied to new situations. Solution generalization replaces a solution to a specific problem with a solution that solves a group of related problems, including that specific problem. It is one form of a new problem-solving technique called *abstraction*. You must learn to generalize the code statements you write by changing the functions, literals, and other objects you use to solve different problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Reflection* has three subtasks: **review code**, **reflection activity**, and **identify solution issues** as illustred in the image below. In **review code**, you should inspect your program statements one at a time and the order that they are run to gain a deeper understanding of the program you wrote. Your goal is to understand how the statements work together to implement the game - you can use the *debugger* (`%debug`)to trace the way that the Python interpreter runs a program. *Tracing* shows the sequential statement by statement evaluation, that the Python interpreter does by default.\n",

Functional tests demonstrate that the code works as intended. The software quality tests ensure that you have made good coding choices and used best programming practices. For this version of the game, you will only use one software quality tests. To check your comments, you must test two kinds of comments: **program comments** and **block comments**. A *program comment* is a summary of what your program does. It must be included at the start of your program. A *block comment* appears on one line above each group of statements that comprise a logical task. It must provide a short explanation of the code that follows it.\n",
