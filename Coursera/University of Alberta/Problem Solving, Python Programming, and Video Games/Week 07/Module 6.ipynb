    "\n",
    "In this version, we are going to introduce one of the most important language features for improving code quality. This version is all about creating your own functions. **Functions** are a very important part of programming, they allow you to decompose your code into self-contained segments. This makes code easier to read, write, modify and reuse, since it allows you to focus on one section of related code at the time, you can apply all the benefits of using built-in and imported functions to using your own functions. A **function** is an example of control abstraction. A function call evaluates the statements inside a function and then returns the calling statement. The function's code can be written once and called many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "User defined functions are another example of *solution generalization*. Recall that *solution generalization* alters the solutions so that you may reuse it in many different contexts. Whoever writes a function is performing solution generalization. Whoever is calling a function is using control abstraction."

    "A complete Python program consists of blocks, and there are three kinds of Python blocks: modules, functions, and classes. The interpreter always starts evaluating the main module, but other blocks are evaluated as well. Functions or blocks and there are two kinds of functions in Python: *user-defined* functions and *built-in* functions. A *user-defined* function is a function whose code consists of Python statements. This is different from the non-Python code used to implement *built-in* functions. *Built-in* functions are written in the language used to implement the Python interpreter. Most Python interpreters are implemented using the C programming language since it is easier to call the necessary operating system functions using C. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python type of a built-in function or method is built-in function or method. For example, both `len` and `sleep` from the `time` module are built-in functions. Since `sleep` is not in the built-in function table, it needed to be imported from the `time` module. The Python type of a *user-defined* function or method is `function`. For example, the function `copy` from the module named copy in the Standard Library is a *user-defined* function. "

When you previously added a new control structure to improve your code quality, it required you to modify the structure of your solution at the algorithm level. Functions also act as control structures since they determine when blocks of code are performed. However, implementing functions and hacking version six does not require you to modify your algorithm. Your complete version five design is still relevant in version six. Creating functions is very similar to decomposing your algorithm into panels which you've been doing all along. Almost every panel in your algorithm will become a function in your code. The title of the panel will be the name of the corresponding function. There will also be two functions that are not represented by panels in the algorithm. Functions are used to create clear, readable code. They divide code into small segments so that each segment can be individually written and tested. They also consolidate statement groups with similar functionality. \n",
