    "\n",
    "Before starting Poke the Dots Version 3, we should look at the solution issues for Version 2. We use classes to improve the quality of the code, but the game still lacks most of the features that make it playable. The player can't interact with the game, except to close the window, and the score is not displayed. In Version 3, we make the game more interactive by handling the *mouse click* event. Remember that Pygame has support for a number of other events, as presented below:\n",

    "## Review Code for Poke the Dots Version 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the final version of poke the dots will not handle key presses, we add in the version 3 of Poke the Dots an example of how to handle keypress events. In this example, anytime we press the `P` key, the dots will teleport the same way they do when the mouse is clicked. In order to do so, we import the `KEYDOWN` event category from the pygame module. A `KEWYDOWN` event is generated whenever any key is pressed, but this program should only respond to the single key `P`. Recall that each event has a type attribute that represents its categories such as mouse button up or keydown. Each event category also has other attributes that represent properties of that event. The `key` attribute of a keydown event represents the key that generated the event. Thus, we must compare `event.key` to a key value. The values for each attribute must be imported from pygame too. The `P` key is labelled as `K_p`. The complete code that handles this event is presented below."

    "In this quiz, your goal is to modify this code for [Poke the Dots Version 3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/problem-solving-programming-video-games/supplement/mNtmr/poke-the-dots-version-3-solution-code), so that the window will also close when the `q` or `Q` key is pressed. The window should still close when the close icon is clicked.\n",

    "```\n",
    "from pygame import MOUSEBUTTONUP, Color, KEYDOWN, K_q\n",

    "**1. In this question, you will add one of the three additional lines to the program. You will add the second line in Question 2 and the third line in Question 3.**\n",

    "What is the `elif` header line that must be added after line **88** so that any `KEYDOWN` event can be recognized and later handled in the suite of this `elif` clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also add a `pass` statement inside the suite of this `elif` clause if you want to run your program without a syntax error. The program should run, but the window won't close yet when you press the `q` or `Q` key since you have not \"handled\" the `KEYDOWN` event yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** ` `\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. In this question, you will add a second new line after the line you added in Question 1 to \"handle\" this `KEYDOWN` event. If you added a pass statement in Question 1, then this second new line should replace the pass statement.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't actually want to close the window to handle this event. Instead, look at what happens in this event loop when the `QUIT` event is handled on line 85. What single statement must be added to the suite of the `elif` clause you added as line **89** in Question 1 to \"handle\" the `KEYDOWN` event?\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to indent this statement when you type your answer for this question, but if add this statement to your code to try it, don't forget to indent it, so it is part of the suite of the `elif` clause.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:** ` `\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. In this question, you will add a third new line between the lines you added in Question 1 and Question 2.**\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the `if` statement header line that must be added so that pressing the `q` or `Q` keys is recognized, and can be \"handled\" in the suite of this if statement, by moving the line you added in question 2 into the suite of this if statement?\n",
