# Module 3: Hacking Version 2

In Module 3, you will identify solution issues in your game. You will apply a second form of the abstraction problem-solving technique, called using templates, to solve a solution issue by using a graphics library. You will then use lexics, syntax, and semantics to learn two new Python statements (assignment, import), two new Python expressions (binary expression, attribute reference), and one new Python type (module). You will employ these Python constructs and a simple graphics library to write, test, and debug Hacking Version 2.
