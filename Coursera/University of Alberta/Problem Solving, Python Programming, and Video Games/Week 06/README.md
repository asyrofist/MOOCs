# Module 5: Hacking Version 4 & 5

In Module 5, you will modify your game design using two new abstraction techniques, called control abstraction and data abstraction. You will explore two different control abstractions, called definite and indefinite repetition. You will learn two new Python statements (for, while), four new Python expressions (subscription expression, expression list, parenthesized expression, list display), and three new Python types (tuple, list, range). You will employ these Python constructs to write, test, and debug Hacking Version 4 and Hacking Version 5.
