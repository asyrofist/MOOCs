    "## Solution Issues in Hacking Version 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In the version 4 of Hacking game, we will address two solution issues: **duplicate code**, and **duplicate data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Duplicate code** refers to the duplicated statements as displaying the header, the passwords and the outcome messages that require the same four lines of code over and over again with only tiny differences. To eliminate adjacent duplicate statement groups we can use a construct called *repetition control* structure, or *loop*. A *loop* is a sequence of code statements that will be repeatedly evaluated until a specific condition is met. Using a repetition control structure to replace duplicate lines is a new form of abstraction called *control abstraction*. *Control abstraction* replaces default sequential program flow with a control structure to reduce repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second solution improvement is eliminating **duplicate data**. For example, the literal float 0.3 is duplicated 23 times in the Hacking program. This is an issue since if I want a shorter delay, I need to change the argument in 23 individual sleep function calls. To solve this problem I can use an *identifies* to represent the values. In general if a literal is used multiple times for the same purpose, an *identifier* should be bound to it so that the literal can be changed in one place. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the changes we are going to make in this version only affect code quality, we don't need to observe or play hacking version 4. There are also no changes to the description or test plan."

    "## Create Algorithm for Hacking Version 4\n",
    "\n",
    "In the algorithm for the version 4 of the Hacking game, we use a new control structure called *definite repetition* or *definite iteration*. *Definite repetition* performs an algorithm step or sequence of steps over and over again a specific number of times. Since the step is performed repeatedly, it's called repetition. *Definite repetition* means that the number of times the step is repeated is prescribed before the repetition starts. It is represented in the algorithm by a `for` icon, which has two words in it (`for` and `in`). The step in the regular rectangle is the step that will be repeated. The `for` icon indicates how many times that step should be repeated. To complete the for icon, you need to select two items from the vocabulary. The first item is the `target` element that you want to use in the repeated step. The second item is the `sequence` that contains the target element. \n",

    "## Python Sequences and Subscription\n",
    "\n",
    "A *sequence* is a finite ordered group of elements where each object has a numerical index between 0 and 1 less than the number of elements in the sequence. There is no sequence type in Python. Instead, sequences are category that include several different Python types. The Python `str` type is one kind of sequence. Each string is a finite ordered group of indexed characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use a Python expression called **subscription** expression to reference an element of a sequence. **Subscription** uses 2 delimiters: left bracket (`[`) and right bracket (`]`). In many programming languages, the elements of a string are objects whose type is `char` which is short for character. However, there's no `char` type in Python. Instead, Python creates a new one element object of `str` type. A simplified syntax diagram for the subscription expression is presented below, along with a generalized syntax diagram for expression that includes subscription. \n",

    "4. If the index object is not a non-negative integer less than the sequence lenght report an indexing error\n",
    "5. Reference the primary object's element at the index\n",
    "\n",
    "In the subscription semantic, step four 4 indicates that the interpreter reports an indexing error for all negative integers. However, the Python can handle some negative index. In such expressions, the last element is considered as `-1`, the element before the last is `-2` and so on. Using an index of `-n` yields the `n`th last element. However, if you use a negative index whose magnitude is too large, you will still get an indexing error."

    "3. If there is a comma, the result object is a tuple that contains all of the evaluated expression objects\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create tuples using a **parenthesized** expression to the syntax diagram for expression. The syintax of the expression is displayed on the image above, and here are its semantics. \n",

Just as there is no literal token for creating a tuple, there is no literal token for creating a list. Instead, there is an expression called a *list display* that uses the comma delimiter and left and right bracket delimiters.

    "Write a Python program that creates an empty **list** and an empty **tuple** and then outputs them as shown in the sample run. The program must then input a *string*, use the `append` method to append the `str` object to the empty **list** and output the **list**. The program must then create a **tuple** that contains the same `str` object and output the **tuple**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you cannot use the append method to append the `str` object to the empty **tuple**, since tuples are immutable. Instead you must use the `tuple` function, with the list containing the `str` object as an argument. The `tuple` function creates a new **tuple** whose elements are the same as the argument object, which in this case is your list containing the `str` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is possible to create your **tuple** using an *expression list*, instead of using the `tuple` function and it is possible to create your **list** using a *list display*:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_tuple = (my_string)\n",
    "my_list = [my_string]\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, for this program you must modify your empty **list** using `append` and create your **tuple** using the `tuple` function so you can discover how to use the append method and the tuple function.\n",

    "```\n",
    "*Tip*: You should never bind the name of a Python type to an object in your program, since if you do, you will not be able to use the function whose name is that type name. For example, if you bind the identifier `str` or `int`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "str = 'hello'\n",
