Identifying these solution issues is key to improving your code, and adding or modifying features in a measured and systematic way. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are updating our game with new attributes, we modify the version 1 description to create a version 2 description. For creating the description for hacking version 2, we have to remove elements (objects, attributes, and actions) that are not used in version 2. For example, the version 1 description indicates that the location of the header is the top line of game output. In version 2 since the header is displayed at the top of the window. Now, we can add elements in version 2, such as the appearance of the game - which uses a graphical window instead of a text-based shell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that every display object has five attributes: *content*, *location*, *size*, *color*, and *timing*. The *content* of each object does not change when we go from text to graphics. So the description of the content attributes will remain the same. When making a graphical game, you must describe the *location* of all objects in the window because you will need to specify these locations in your program. In a text-based game, each print col argument was displayed on a consecutive line without specifying location. The attribute *size* means font size (small, medium, and large) in the descriptions. For *colour*, the version 2 of the game shows green on black. The last attribute is *timing*, which in version 2 is the temporal attribute to display each line.\n",

This is often easer than using the `+` operator to concatenate several strings together and then printing the single string. It is especially easier to use a multi-argument print function call when some of the objects you want to print are not string objects since you don't need to call the `str()` function to convert these objects to strings. The `print` function call does the conversion to strings for you."

The prompt must be in the top left corner of the window. Then, display the input string in the bottom right hand corner of the window. This program must work for any reasonable font size, so your program must use the `Window` methods named: `get_width`, `get_string_width`, `get_height`, and `get_font_height` to compute the `display_string` coordinates for displaying the string in the bottom right corner. The program should pause for 2 seconds after the string appears in the window and then the window should close. Your program must not input or display any other information.**"
