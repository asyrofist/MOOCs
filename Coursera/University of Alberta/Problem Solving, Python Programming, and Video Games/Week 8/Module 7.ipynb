    "Although we finished the last version of Hacking, we could add many other improvements. For example, Hacking gameplay could be improved by randomly choosing a password from the password list, as the correct password. In addition, you could create a large list of passwords and randomly choose 13 from that list to be used in the game. Then every game would have a random selection of words and a random correct password. It would make testing more difficult, but it would also make the game much more fun to play. You can also increase the difficulty of the game. You could choose how many guesses players get based on their skill in previous games. A player who consistently guess the password in three guesses, would have the total attempts reduced from four. A player who doesn't win often or at all, with four guesses, could be given more attempts. Another way to make the game more challenging, is to erase some of the characters of the passwords in the password list, so that the player needs to guess what the missing letters are."
