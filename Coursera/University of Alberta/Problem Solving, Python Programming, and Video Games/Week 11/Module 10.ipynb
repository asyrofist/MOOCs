    "## Solution Issues in Poke the Dots Version 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In version four of Poke the Dots, we focus on improving the quality of the code. Adding classes in version two allowed the code to pass the software quality test that states function should have no more than five arguments. In version three, we discussed how classes are formed of data encapsulation because they group component objects together to be used as one entity. However, encapsulation also prescribes that the internal details of an encapsulated object should be hidden. Therefore, we should not access the attributes of any object outside its class definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of data encapsulation for the Game and Dot classes is not complete because the attributes of these classes are bound and accessed outside the class definitions. To fix this, we have to add code to the currently empty Game and Dot class definitions to bind the attributes inside these definitions. Some attributes such as the title and size of a window or the color and center of a dot vary between different windows and dots that are created. Instead of the window function which has arguments that pass the title and size objects so they can be used to create an appropriate window object. If we add arguments to the Game and Dot functions, these arguments can be used to bind attributes when the objects are created. Other attributes can also be bound when an object is created but do not need to be passed as arguments (*e.g.*, the game's frame rate). \n",
    "\n",
    "If an attribute needs to be changed during the program, encapsulation prohibits the attribute from being rebound outside the class definition. Therefore, a method should be used to change the attribute (*e.g.*, the `set_fontsize` method is used to change the font size of a window. **Methods** are functions defined inside of a class that let you modify and return information about an object without directly accessing attributes outside the class definition. **Methods** and **classes** encapsulate behaviors as well as data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavior encapsulation** refers to grouping all the behaviors or actions that can be applied to an object the same way **data encapsulation** groups all the information about an object. Encapsulating both data and behaviors within a class definition uses a concept called **information hiding**. **Information hiding** is a design technique that limits access to details about data and code. Using a class tells programmers not to modify the implementation details of a class outside of its definition. Using encapsulation and information hiding allows you to use a class without having to change the external code if the information inside the class changes. Python does not strictly enforce the do not touch convention for code inside of a class definition. Other languages have stronger mechanisms for enforcing information hiding such as a series of keywords that you can use to indicate which information should be private. Python uses *convention* rather than language features, and trust programmers to follow the conventions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Version four of Poke the Dots focuses on code quality by adding methods to user-defined classes. So the functionality of this version doesn't change."

    "## Python User-defined Methods and Self\n",
    "\n",
    "A function that is defined inside a class is called a method. Every method must be applied to an object whose type is the class where the method is defined. A user defined method is created by placing a function definition inside the suite of the class that defines it. One extra parameter is added to the start of the function definition, and this parameter is bound to the *special* argument when the method is called. When a function definition appears inside a class, the function name is added to the namespace of the class object. This is what makes a function a method. Any function whose name is bound inside the namespace of a class object is created as a method object instead of a normal function object. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we add the extra *special* argument to the function object of a class, we must generalize the function call semantics to support calls to functions which are class objects by adding a new step three. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate the expression to obtain a function object\n",
    "2. If there is an argument list, evaluate it to obtain an argument object list, otherwise create an empty argument object list\n",
    "3. If the function object is a class, create a new object whose type is that class. Then apply __init__ method to the new object and return this new object as result object.\n",
    "4. If the argument list length is not equal to the parameter list length report an error\n",
    "5. Add each identifier in the parameter list to the function namespace and bind it to an argument object, in order\n",
    "6. Evaluate the function code to obtain a result object and clear the local namespace of all names bound during function call execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, When an attribute is not found in an object, the interpreter searches for that attribute in its class. This updates our simplified semantics of attributes reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate the expression to get an object.\n",
    "2. If the attribute in the namespace of the object, return the object it is bound to. Otherwise if the attribute is in the namespace of the object's class, return the object it is bound to. Otherwise, report an attribute error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class can use any name as *special* name of the parameter that is bound to the special object. However, Python has a convention that `self` is used as the initial parameter name. If a class definition does not contain an `__init__` method, Python applies a default init method that doesn't do anything. The underscores must be used so that Python can find the init method. For example, the code below illustrates how we can use the `self` value as with any other name, such as `my_self`."

    "**Encapsulation** is a technique for restricting access to the implementation of a component so that, that implementation of that component is independent of how it is used by other components. If access to attributes is restricted to the class in which they are defined, then objects can be used independently of the implementation of an object's class, achieving encapsulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming languages have features that can be used to prevent access to attributes outside of the class where they are defined. For example, Java and C++ both use the keyword private so that an error is generated when an attribute is accessed outside of its class definition. Python does not have a keyword that prevents an attribute from being accessed outside of a class definition, instead, Python has a convention. **Any attribute that starts with a single underscore should be treated as private, *i.e.*, it should not be used outside of the class definition that defines it**.

    "It is impossible to differentiate between **normal function calls**, **class function calls** and **method calls** just by looking at their syntax. For example, we only know from experience that `time.sleep` is a function and `window.set_font_name` is a method, since they both have identical syntax (`<identifier>.<identifier>(<arguments>)`). Whether a function is normal, class or method depends on whether the identifier before the parentheses is a normal function object, a class function object or a method object. There are three common ways to determine the exact type of the function object an identifier is bound to. You could **call the print function** on this object, you could **look at the code** where the object is defined (if you have access to it) or you **could check the documentation**, which is the usual way. \n",
