    "## Software Architect and Design Roles in Industry\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many roles in the software industry, the software designer or a software architect role can look very different from company to company. Characteristics like company size, the scope of the project, the experience of the development team, the organizational structure and the age of the company can all impact what these roles look like. In some companies, there may be a distinct role for a software designer or architect. In other companies, the design may be completed by a member or members of the development team. Typically, the **software designer** role would be responsible for outlining a software solution to a specific problem by designing the details of individual components and their responsibilities. A **software architect** role would be responsible for looking at the entire system and choosing appropriate frameworks, data storage, solutions and determining how components interact with each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "That brings us to the primary difference between software design and software architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Software design** looks at the lower level aspects of a system.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **Software architecture** tends to look at the bigger picture, the higher level aspects of a system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this like designing a building. An architect focuses on the major structures and services, while an interior designer focuses on the smaller spaces within. Great software designers and architects are detail-oriented, forward thinkers. They need to be able to see the product at both the low and high levels. They need to be creative problem solvers in order to come up with a quality solution for the problem at hand. They need to be able to express these ideas effectively with the product manager and the development team. \n",
    "\n",
    "Software design and architecture is essential to the software development process. Let's take a look at what people in the industry feel about this role. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: What is software design?**<br>\n",
    "> [Greg Coulomb] **Software design** is the process of turning the wishes and requirements of a customer into working code that is stable and maintainable in the long run, and can be evolved and can become part of a larger system. That's software design. \n",
    "\n",
    "> [H James Hoover] I like the or because I don't make a distinction between software architecture and software design. I think they're just the same problem at a different scale. Way I like to think of it is that architecture is primarily, begins with understanding what's the business problem that the client needs to solve. Where business doesn't mean necessarily financial business, any business. Once you've realized that that's your primary task, which is to figure out what the client wants, then everything kind of falls in after that. Because If you understand the problem, then you can start to think about what, in your previous experience, as possible solutions, and then you start getting a idea of how your overall solution is going to look like. And that's where I kind of say, really architecture is the study of boxes and lines. Because your first description of what it is you're trying to do is simply a set of boxes with things inside them and lines expressing relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: Why is software design and architecture important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Greg Coulomb] Design and architecture is important if you want to have a stable, long-lived system. Anybody can build a system that'll last a week or a month or a year, but if you want to build something that is the basis of other people's work and contribution over potentially a period of years or longer, in some cases, you need to put some thought into it. You need to have somebody whose job it is to look out for the long game and make sure that you are not making suboptimal short term decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "> [H James Hoover] Architecture is important because if you get it wrong, your project will fail. That's it. It's just that simple. Fng the term architecture to be this understanding of the relationship between the requirements of the user and the ability to build a system that will deliver those requirements. I think you can trace back most major software failures to bad architecture, where architecture is used in this general sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: What are the key challenges in software design and architecture?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Greg Coulomb] One of the key challenges in software architecture is the tendency to have to trade off between speed and quality, If I boil it down, right? I think there's a tendency for the customer in the business to want their, their software, to want their results as soon as possible. And there's a tendency for the engineering team to want to build, the most robust, thoroughly designed, thoroughly implemented system possible. And so we trading off between these things all the time. And I think, it's that tension in that trade off is where you get really good software, you get good designs out of that, but it's a process you have to go through to go through that. \n",
    "\n",
    "> [H James Hoover] So our biggest issue that we face is understanding the client's problem. What is it they really want to do? And in many cases the client actually doesn't know what they want to do either. They come in with only a partial understanding, a vague kind of sense that they could be doing things better. But often, one of our first task is to actually help them understand, with more precision, what their business is.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: What does a software architect do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Greg Coulomb] A software architect's job is to be the interface between the product and the customer and the engineering teams. And so for instance, customers will express a requirement or a need they have of the, of the software and it's the architect's job to then work with the customers and their representatives, product managers and such, to come up with the technical requirements of how we're going to solve the problem. And then they take those requirements to the engineering teams and worked with the engineers on how to realize that in a way that is meeting the customer's requirements and also aligned with the technical best practices and nonfunctional requirements that have to be adhered to in the product. \n",
    "\n",
    "> [H James Hoover] The software architect is like a building architect. They're responsible for the overall conceptual integrity of the project. Their main goal is to serve the needs of the customer within the budget that the customer has. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: How do you express design or architecture to developers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Greg Coulomb] I would express software design or software architecture in a couple of different ways. For small things, for simple things, you'll sit with an engineer and you'll whiteboard something out and you'll come up with a design that way and you'll basically get them going. For larger initiatives, larger projects, you're typically writing fairly substantial design specification documents, where you're exploring all the different possible use cases, all the different possible flow variations and things of this kind, in addition to all of those critical functional and nonfunctional requirements, stability, maintainability, these kinds of things. So, in general, I would say that we communicate software architecture through the written word, through wikis, through white papers, these kinds of things, in addition to fairly detailed engineering design schematics, class diagrams, if necessary, big box diagrams, if it's just a simple high level architecture design. \n",
    "\n",
    "> [H James Hoover] I've been programming for 45 years and one thing I've learned is that the only thing that's really there is the code and everything else that you talk about is views on the code. So, I like to express architecture or describe architecture as saying that, all the things that I'm going to do, the boxes and lines, the prose, the fancy diagrams of the diagrams on napkins, there are simply indexes into the code. That's how you find your way to the actual artifact that's actually doing what you want to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: What principles do you follow when designing software?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Greg Coulomb] I tend to apply simplicity first as my main principle, if I'm looking at how I'm approaching the problem. That's the filter that I try to use on it. And I often will find myself, there's a tendency in people to complicate things, to inject complexity because it's interesting. As an engineer, as a technical person, complexity is fun and interesting. And it's only when you stripped away all the unnecessary complexity that you realize you've got the core of a great solution to a problem. And so, I really try to do that and when I'm working with product teams and engineers alike, that simplicity principle really helps to cut through a lot of the confusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "> [H James Hoover] What's the most important principle? Simplicity. That's true and it's the engineering maxim to keep it simple. The reason for that is twofold. One is that if it's simple, you probably have a pretty good chance of getting it right or almost right. That's one part. The other thing is if it's simple, then you can explain it to someone simply, that communication of architecture is important because you're not going to be around forever. And you need to transfer your knowledge over to someone else. And if it's not simple, the knowledge transfer cost is higher because it's more complicated to explain and the chances of misunderstanding are much higher. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: How did you become interested in software design and architecture?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Greg Coulomb] So, I became interested in software design by working as an engineer and being exposed to larger scale code bases, you know, progressively over the years. When I first started, of course, I worked on mostly very, very small things. And I was very interested in how software was put together and the design at, a micro design level. And then, as I proceeded in my career and I started to be exposed to some fairly large pieces of software that served millions of people, I got really interested in how those things are put together and what is it that makes that successful. And how do you make sure that you're not having to re-implement this thing over and over and over again. And I found that to be a really interesting side of the business that I really hadn't explored before. And so it turns out I really enjoyed that. \n",
    "\n",
    "> [H James Hoover] I think, if you start writing code to do things, to play around, you start asking yourself questions about: well, why is it that this code is really nice to work with and this code here is horrible? And you start asking yourself questions about design and the difference between design and architecture in the software business is, there really isn't any because our business is all self-similar. Issues that you ask about programs are the same issues you can ask about big systems. And I think in my case, I just became interested in this fundamental understanding of the issue of building software artifacts. And then it just naturally scales up, at some point you're building systems with a hundred thousand lines of code. And then, you suddenly realize on your project team that you don't have a million lines of code. And you're now a software architect because you have a million lines of code whereas before you were just a programmer you only had 10,000 lines of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: What is a typical career path for a software architect?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Greg Coulomb] Most architects that I know started as software engineers. Usually as an intern or a new grad and they work basically overtime. They work on progressively larger and larger pieces of the software that they're responsible for. And what happens is, you start to see those engineers get to a level of comfort where they start to push outside of the code base that they're indirectly responsible for. And they start involving themselves in discussions around the larger impacts to the system of the work that's being done. And that just generally continues until all of a sudden they're actually working at a much higher level of abstraction. And then contributing at a very different level and so that's how you know you've got an architect on your hands. \n",
    "\n",
    "> [H James Hoover] Yeah, there's not a career path into software architecture. What it really is is, if you think of architects as having more responsibility than programmers, what it really is as a career path where you get more and more responsibility, that you do by demonstrating that you're actually good at building things. My experience has been that I didn't think I was a expert programmer until I had been out in the world for 10 years and I think that's consistent with many of my colleagues. Over that period, you start working on bigger and bigger systems and eventually someone trusts you with being the point person to put together a design for a much larger system than you'd ever done before. And then once you've done one of those and it hasn't been a total disaster, you get an even bigger system. So I guess, it's gradual building of your reputation is what makes you into a software architect. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: What is exciting about being a software designer or architect?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Greg Coulomb] I would say the most exciting thing about being a software architect is the satisfaction of seeing the final product put together and out there and being used by real people to good effect, right. Because you spend all this time early on in a project and you have to fight for your nonfunctional requirements and you have to fight for how this is all going to be put together. And then when it all comes together and you've done all that negotiation and it's out there in the hands of a customer and it's valuable, there's a real sense of pride with that. I think, additionally, you also get a lot of satisfaction and pride from making the right call in terms of long term viability of a code base and of a project. And so seeing somebody be able to come to your product, maybe years later, and make some very business critical contribution extension of something that you designed, without having to redesign it, is very satisfying. It tells you that you hit it on the right mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [H James Hoover] What's exciting in architecture? Well in general, you don't want too much excitement because that's usually associated with some sort of looming disaster. But what's interesting about software architecture, and that continues to make it interesting, is that someone always has a problem that's slightly different than all the problems you've seen before, which means that your previous solutions aren't necessarily going to work and you get to do something new. So, it's the novelty that makes up architecture interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: What skills are needed in being a software designer or architect?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Greg Coulomb] An architect has to have a number of important skills, obviously, deep technical expertise is table stakes. You have to be a technical guru, I think, at a certain level. In addition to that, you need to be able to communicate with people at the level that they want to be communicated with. So if you're talking to a business person, they don't want to hear about your code. They want to hear about their business problems. And they want to hear how you're solving their business problems. If you're talking to an engineer, they want to know the business context but they need you to talk to them about code. And so, it's really important to have that ability to understand how the person you're talking to wants to be communicated with. So empathic communication, I would say, is really important. Additionally, some basic functional skills like a little bit of project planning and organizational skills, being able to keep a backlog of work so that you don't forget about things. Be able to juggle a lot of different competing concerns at the same time is also a very important skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [H James Hoover] The most important ones are what I would call, the soft people skills that you need in order to get people to tell you what their requirements are. This is very hard actually, especially in situations of uncertainty. Clients are very reluctant typically, to tell you the things that they're really bad at. They like to tell you all the things that they know how to do but they're reluctant to express where their understanding of a problem is incomplete or where their business processes just don't work right. And, if you don't identify those areas, you've actually encountered a big risk in your project, because those are the areas that are the problem. The well understood parts of a client's needs are not an issue. It's the parts that are fuzzy and not well understood. But of all the technical skills that you've got, you need this meta skill, which is to look at various technologies and ideas and decide, is that going to be useful to me or not in my particular problem I'm trying to solve? So as an architect, you have to know a lot about what's out there. But not in a tremendous amount of detail because a lot of the stuff that's out there, isn't going to be useful to you, at least immediately. By the time you might need it, it's probably gone through 10 releases anyway and isn't the same thing. So you have to have the skill of being able to quickly assess various technologies and fit them into your understanding of the discipline. So new language comes out, you so say, \"Oh yeah, this is yet another procedural language with nothing much different than all these other ones.\" Or you might see something else and says, \"Oh, that's interesting. I wonder if this particular style of approaching the problem, perhaps, aspect oriented programming, just to pull something of the air, will actually help me solve my problem in a better way or express my problem in a better way.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: How do you keep yourself up to date with new technologies?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Greg Coulomb] Well, staying up to date is a bit of a trick. It's about exposing yourself to as much as you can in the outside world and inside your own company, as well. But in particular, you know, look at what the big companies are doing. What's Apple doing? What's Google doing? What's Amazon doing? And you read their blogs. You play with their software. You get an account on whichever tool you want to use and you start using those things. And you use that for inspiration. And just to see how others are approaching architecture in their systems, right? So there's a number of levels of inspiration there, I think. Additionally, read a lot of just the general tech press and find out what's going on out there in the world. Read academic journals for the appropriate areas and see what's coming a little farther down the line. What are the academics thinking about? So there's lots of those things to go after. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: What advice would you give to a new software design or architect?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Greg Coulomb] So the advice I would give to a new software architect is to get as comfortable talking to people as you can and meet as many people as you as humanly possible. Expose yourself to as many ideas as you can. And share your own perspective as well. And I think it's by leveraging the community, leveraging those around you, that you're going to be inspired to be creative in your architecture and you're going to get a better understanding of the context in which you're operating, both within your business as well as the broader technology landscape out there. And it'll help you to make better choices, ultimately. \n",
    "\n",
    "> [H James Hoover] The advice you give to new software architect is the same advice you give to a musician. Try and play with people who are much better than you are because that's how you become a better architect. And that means working with people who are better than you are. If you have the opportunity, at the very least, try to read as much of the foundational literature in the field and there's not that much to read. There's a maybe 20 key resources you should go to. Some of them dating back to the original papers in the 70s about coupling and cohesion. And then, of course, writing code. So you need to work with people that are better than you are. Read a lot of code and read a lot of code and that's how you become a software architect. Oh and of course, learning from your mistakes is also quite valuable."

    "# Object-Oriented Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard the term **Object-Oriented Modeling**, you may have even applied it whether you knew it or not. Object-oriented Modeling is a major topic in this specialization. So what is it? \n",
    "\n",
    "> When solving a problem, object-oriented modeling involves the practice of representing key concepts through objects in your software. Depending on the problem, many concepts, even instances of people, places or things become distinct objects in the software. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think in terms of objects. Objects are all around you. Take a look around, what do you see? I'm guessing you see a computer or a tablet. You may also see other physical objects like a table, a door or a coffee mug. Is there anyone else in the room? They are objects as well. The room itself is even an object. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/room.svg\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So why should you use objects to represent things in your code? It is a way of keeping your code organized, flexible and reusable. It keeps code organized by having related details and specific functions in distinct, easy to find places. This creates flexibility because you can easily change details in a modular way without affecting the rest of the code. You can also reuse code and keep your program simple. Let's explore what object-oriented modeling might look like. Consider the seminar room for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/room.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first object we identify is the room itself. The room has details such as the room number and the seating capacity of the room. We can also identify objects that are contained within this room. What are some of these objects? Have a look around this room. There are many physical objects such as the chair, the table, the projector and the white board. Each of these physical objects could be represented by objects in software. There are specific details associated with each object. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The projector has specs related to its performance such as resolution and brightness. \n",
    "- A chair has its own details such as seat dimensions that would be relevant to a user of that object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Objects can also have individual responsibilities or behaviors. For example, the projector is responsible to power on, take a video input and display an image. What about a person as an object? That works too. Let's put a person object in this room. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A person object would have details such as name, age, gender and occupation. \n",
    "- There are also countless behaviors that a person object could complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a person could write on the white board, turn on the projector, sit in a chair or open his laptop on the table. It's easy to think about people or electronics knowing about the information when achieving behaviors. For example, a person object knows their name and age and a laptop knows its specs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented modeling, even inanimate objects know their information. So a chair knows its dimensions and location. A door knows its frame height and the angle that the door is ajar. The white board knows its height and width as well as if it's blank or contains writing. With object-oriented thinking, you often think of everything as objects even living things. And all these objects are self-aware even inanimate things."

    "## Software Requirements, Conceptual and Technical Designs\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of developing software as a process that takes a problem and produces a solution involving software. Normally, it's an iterative process, with each iteration taking a set of requirements through to a working and tested implementation and eventually building up a complete solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/iterative_process.svg\" width=\"70%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Many developers are eager to go straight into coding despite not fully understanding what to program in the first place. Evidence suggest that diving straight into implementation work is a leading cause of project failure. In a survey from The Standish Group, the most common causes of project failures are related to issues in requirements and design. For example, about 13% of respondents noted incomplete requirements impaired their projects. Unless you want your projects to fail, take your time to form requirements and create a design. You might not get them perfect, but their importance to effectively making good software should not be overlooked. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may be eager to tackle implementation work and get something working, but the requirements and design activities are critical. Once you begin coding a solution and depend on certain assumptions, it can become difficult to change those assumptions. For the design phase, you will have to think like an architect, which means thinking about the structure and behavior of your software. Consider the following scenario. You're hired to design a house. Before you start laying the foundation, you must first understand what the homeowner wants. This starting point is known as eliciting requirements. The homeowner wants a single story house. It needs to have a gym, a bathroom, three bedrooms and a living room. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/house.svg\" width=\"40%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Eliciting requirements involves not only listening to what the client is telling you, but asking questions to clarify what the client has not told you. For instance, did it strike you as odd that this house has no kitchen? That would be a natural follow up question. Do you anticipate needing a kitchen? Should the rooms all be same size? If not, which should be bigger or smaller? How big should the house be overall? Are there external design constraints? For example, building restrictions put in place by the community? Should the house face a particular direction to take advantage of passive solar energy or scenic views? Which rooms should be furthest apart? Which rooms should be close together? The art of eliciting requirements is found in asking revealing follow up questions. Once these questions are answered, you now have an initial set of requirements allowing you to start thinking of possible designs. **The design activity involves taking requirements and outlining a solution**. This activity involves producing a conceptual design and then a technical design, which results in two corresponding kinds of artifacts, conceptual mockups and technical diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual mockups** provide your initial thoughts for how the requirements will be satisfied. At this point, you focus on the house design by identifying major components and connections and defer the technical details. For example, the components from your house project are, the lot on which the house will be situated, the house itself, the kitchen, the gym, the bathroom, the bedrooms and the living room. Connections in the house can relate the components. For example if the living room is openly accessible from the kitchen, the living room has a connection to the kitchen. Each component has a task it needs to perform, known as **responsibility**. For instance, the gym's responsibility is to provide the homeowner with space and power for fitness activities and equipment. Similarly, the kitchen's main responsibility is to provide space for storing kitchenware, appliances, food supplies, and power and water for meal preparation. As a main component, the house has the overall responsibility of providing enough power, water, and support for all the required components within it. Note, how we don't mention specifics about wiring and plumbing. These are technical details that cannot be fully addressed until the conceptual mockups are completely understood. For instance, determining the size of the electrical distribution panel for the house will require adding up the power requirements necessary to energize each of the rooms. I recommend finishing the conceptual design before moving on to forming the technical design. The clearer your conceptual design is, the better your technical designs will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with the architectural example, you've wowed the homeowner with your conceptual design and, together, now have a shared vision for the dream home that will now be built. After the conceptual mockups are done, it is time to define the technical details of the solution. From the conceptual design, you know all the major components and connections and their associated responsibilities. **Describing how these responsibilities are met is the goal of technical design**. In a technical design, you start specifying the technical details of each component. This is done by splitting components into smaller and smaller components that are specific enough to be designed in detail. For example, the gym component will require further components like a floor. The floor will be responsible for supporting a lot of weight. Are homeowner is training to be an Olympic lifter. By breaking down components more and more into further components, each with specific responsibilities, you get down to a level where you can do a detailed design of a particular component, such as, describing how to reinforce the floor. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical diagrams** express how to address specific issues like this. Compromises might arise when creating an acceptable solution. What if reinforcing the floor of the gym requires putting in columns or beams in the basement below the gym? What if the homeowner also wanted a wide open space in the basement with good head room? Sometimes conflicts like this can happen. You and the homeowner will need to workout a compromise in the solution. Constant communication and feedback is key, so that the solution is acceptable. If components and connections and their responsibilities in your conceptual design prove impossible to achieve in the technical design or fail to meet the requirements, you will need to go back to your conceptual design and rework it. Once you come to a feasible design, you want to continuously check with your client that the conceptual mockups capture what they want. In the architectural example, such checks are important. Because you'd rather adjust the design on paper than demolish an actual wall later. The technical diagrams then become the basis for constructing the intended solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply what we have seen as a building architect to software design. Suppose you have a design task for a university course search website with the following requirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "> As a learner, I want to search for relevant courses through a search page.\n",
    "\n",
    "In making a conceptual design of a building, we try to recognize appropriate components, connections and responsibilities and avoid technical details. An architect starts with a sketch of the building with the components, connections and responsibilities in mind. When it comes to conceptual design and software involving user interfaces, conceptual mockups can be a hand drawn sketch or a drawing made using computer tools. When we look at our requirement, \"*As a learner, I want to search for relevant courses through a search page*\". We recognize search page and course as the components, and the search page has the responsibility of searching for relevant courses. By sketching a mockup of our user interface, we notice many missing components.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/search.svg\" width=\"40%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You're probably wondering about how a search keyword is entered in the search page. How is the search started? How is the list of search results displayed? These flaws in the initial mockup require further clarification with your client, or more conceptual design work. Eventually, we generate a more comprehensive conceptual design or user interface mockup. The search page contains an input field and search button, and transitions to the result page. Course is a way of displaying the result. From this mock up, we recognize many connections. For example, for the search page to fulfill its responsibility to search, it needs, Input Field, Search button, and Results Page. This also translates to Search Page having connections to Input Field, Search button, and Results Page.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a conceptual design, we move to making a technical design where, just like building design, you try to add a detail how those components, connections and responsibilities can be implemented. For example, we refine each component until it is specific enough to be designed in detail. For example, how does the search page fulfill its responsibility of searching a list of courses for relevant ones, given that a user has entered a keyword? Does the page need to talk to an external system? Suppose the university already has a Course Database component which your course Search Page can connect to. Since Search Page requires Course Database in order to fulfill its responsibility of search, a connection exists between Search Page and Course Database. Here, we can't really use a conceptual user interface mockup, since we are now designing internal software components. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Components** turn into collections of functions, classes or other components. These pieces then represent a much simpler problem that the developers can individually implement. You can easily imagine that larger systems require more design time. With large systems, there are also more components, connections and responsibilities to keep track of. And since these components themselves will be big, they will be refined to many more components before the design can be detailed. "

    "## Competing Qualities and Trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "As you design software to satisfy requirements, you have to make many important decisions. Certain design decisions involve trade-offs in different quality attributes such as performance, convenience and security. Think about balancing such qualities when designing a front door to a house. You want to make your home more secure in the most direct way. So, you decide to add locks. You add a single lock and don't feel very secure. It's easy to open and close the door very quickly. So, you continue to add extra security. You keep adding locks until you realize it's very time consuming and inconvenient to unlock your door. Instead of mindlessly adding locks, you must come up with a design that balances security with both convenience and performance in mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "When designing software, it is important to consider how qualities can compete in a proposed solution under different situations and determine a suitable compromise. This is a constant balancing act for a software architect. Let's talk to an expert about how competing qualities constantly influence their implementations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: What qualities do you often balance in designing software?**\n",
    "\n",
    "> [Greg Coulomb] Yeah, there's always a lot of competing concerns with software design and I think, obviously, from a product perspective, you have things like usability and performance. Obviously, those are are critical. Scalability is always important. Where the trade-offs really seem to be important is when it comes to security, code quality, time to market. These kinds of things where everybody wants and you need to be secure, right? And you need to have high quality. But the pressure that you have from product, to get something out the door, is sometimes at odds with those requirements. And *as an architect, its your job to fight for those things and to advocate for them in the context of the business*. So, it's not slavishly sticking to a point and to the point that you're damaging your business, but it's about advocating responsibly for the quality of the code base that you're producing. So, I think if I would summarize, quality is the job of the architect. You're ensuring the quality of the code base and you're trading that off against lots of things all the time.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Architecture is about producing a quality product and you have to define what quality is. That's what architecture is, right? It is that you're defining what are those quality attributes that you're chasing after. And you're going to deal with performance, you're going to deal with scalability, you're going to deal with maintainability, security, all that stuff. Also, you want your job to advocate for that quality for all of the stakeholders, right? Engineers need quality, customers need quality, the business needs quality. So, I think overall, I mean you're always bouncing a lot of things. Architecture is all about balancing competing concerns. But if I boil it down to the most important, it's you're balancing quality versus time to market. Right? So, as customers, as businesses, we want to get things into market. We want to start making money off of them or serving our customers or whatever it might be. And as engineers, we have a tendency to say we want it to be perfect. We want it to be 100% code coverage. We want it to be tested every way possible. It's got to support as much load as you could ever possibly throw at it. But the reality is there's always a trade-off there. And so, as an architect, you have to be able to establish what is good enough, right? What are the non-negotiables? What must you do? And then, what can you negotiate on? And once you establish that as an architect, you've made a really good job of establishing those guardrails and then the team can execute from there. The business and the engineering team can execute from there. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Context** is important to determine what choice of solution is right for the balance of qualities. For example, a home located in a low crime area will require different security needs from one located in a high crime area. For software, talking to its stakeholders will help you to understand the context. Sometimes choices made in your software designs can have unintended consequences. For example, an idea that seems to work fine for a relatively small amount of data may become impractical if there is a need to deal with a lot more data. It's good to get other perspectives on your technical designs for a more rounded implementation. These perspectives can be in the form of asking other developers for their opinion or having a design review session. In the home example, you may decide to install bars on the window of a house built in high crime neighborhood. However, the bars might have the unintended consequence of preventing an escape through the windows in case of fire. These consequences could have been avoided if a fire marshal's perspective had been considered before implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides design reviews, it is worthwhile to slow down while implementing a system and test it carefully. You can prototype alternative ideas and run tests to see what works best. If a design decision has unintended consequences, tests can help to catch them. In the same way for the home example, running an emergency escape drill would detect the bars as impeding a fast escape. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how various qualities arise which influence your software design. For software, there are *functional requirements*. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Functional requirements** describe what the system or application is expected to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a media app has a functional requirement of being able to download a full length movie. Naturally, a software design needs to outline a solution to meet such requirements correctly. So, a key quality to satisfy is simply correctness. Besides functional requirements, there are also *non-functional requirements*. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Non-functional requirements** specify how well the system or application does what it does. Such requirements may describe how well the software runs in particular situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the media app can have non-functional requirements to download a full length movie at a specific speed and to play such a movie within a certain memory limit. Beyond *correctness*, other qualities to satisfy include *performance*, *resource usage* and *efficiency*, in terms that can be measured from the running software. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both functional and non-functional requirements are important to satisfy. You'll need to discuss what is acceptable with the stakeholders. The desired qualities will put constraints on your system's design. Consider an analogy involving categories of cars. Both *sports cars* and *popular cars* meet the functional requirement of providing transportation. But each category, indeed each model of car, offers a different balance of achieved non-functional requirements with different factors like *acceleration*, *handling*, *cargo capacity*, *weight* and *fuel economy*. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/cars.svg\" width=\"60%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another kind of non-functional requirement concerns how well the code of the software can evolve. For example, parts of the implementation may have to support use in other similar software products. Also, the implementation may have to allow for future changes. So, other qualities to satisfy for the software can include *re-usability*, *flexibility* and *maintainability*. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the design gets detailed and the implementation is constructed, the required quality should be verified through techniques like *reviews* and *tests*. As well, certain qualities can be validated with *feedback from end users*. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to keep many qualities in mind when designing software. It's not enough to write any code you want if it works to meet the desired functional requirements. There are multiple perspectives to consider. You must satisfy qualities that matter to the users of the software, as well as those for its developers. In software design, your starting point is ensuring your software structure suits the balance of qualities desired. How the structure is organized may affect the performance as seen by the users, as well as the re-usability and maintainability as seen by the developers. In particular, there is a common trade-off between performance and maintainability. High performance code may be less clear and less modular making it less maintainable. Another trade-off is security and performance. The extra overhead for high security may reduce performance. Extra code for backward compatibility can worsen both performance and maintainability. Achieving the extremes in such competing qualities can, in a way, pit users against developers or users against other users. Generally, you have to strike a balance during design. You should ask how much performance, maintainability, security or backward compatibility is needed. Can you cut back on performance to gain more security? Can you drop some backward compatibility to have better performance? \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally project realities will impose compromises on your design. You must balance the software qualities with the resources you have to develop your product. Thinking about quality attributes gives a broader view on how you can achieve the desired requirements in your design. You now understand these qualities as competing ideals that must be balanced. When asked to satisfy a quality, you will consider multiple perspectives and look for potential trade-offs."

    "## Record, Organize, and Refine Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note cards** are often used when planning a speech. You can represent each of your talking points on a card. The speech only makes sense if you ordered the cards in a way that you move logically from one talking point to the next. It would be nice if we had something similar to map out the structure of the software logically when forming its design. The good news is we do. You identify *components*, *connections* and *responsibilities* from some requirements when forming the conceptual design. This is where you give your initial thoughts on how you might satisfy the requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the technical design, you learned how these components and connections are further refined to give them technical details. This makes them easier to implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/conceptual_design.svg\" width=\"70%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although identifying components, their responsibilities and connections, is a good first step in software design, we haven't yet demonstrated a way of representing them. Being able to play with our design, like reordering note cards and speech planning would be valuable. In this lesson, you will learn about an important technique for representing this information at a high level when forming the conceptual design. This technique uses **CRC cards** where CRC stands for **Class, Responsibility, Collaborator**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to how note cards help you organize your talking points, CRC cards help you to organize your components into classes, identify the responsibilities and determine how they will collaborate with each other. To learn about CRC cards in a software design, let's have a mini software system we can play with. Consider a bank machine, for instance. You insert your bank card into the bank machine, the bank machine will then ask you to enter a PIN authenticating you for access. After that, you can choose to deposit, withdraw or check your balances. This scenario suggests the basic requirements for the system. Admittedly, it is an incomplete set of requirements but it's a good start. Remember that requirements are often incomplete and are resolved with further interactions with your client and end users. The next step is to design the bank machine. But as we form the conceptual design beyond just identifying *components*, their *responsibilities* and *connections*, we are going to represent them with our new technique, the CRC card. \n",
    "\n",
    "Much like how note cards are used to organize your talking points, CRC cards are used to record, organize and refine the components in your design. Again, CRC stands for **Class**, **Responsibility** and **Collaborator**. A CRC card has three sections. The top of the card has the class name. On the left are the responsibilities of the class, and on the right, you list collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/crc_cards.svg\" width=\"25%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaborators** are other classes that the class interacts with to fulfill its responsibilities. So, how can we use this while forming the conceptual design? To keep track of each candidate component and its responsibilities using a CRC card, you place a *component's name* in the class name section and the *responsibilities* in the **responsibilities** section. So, what about the connections? In the **collaborators** section, you list other components that your current component connects to or interacts with to fulfill its responsibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "A CRC card can be as simple as a physical index card marked into three sections. They are cheap, editable and widely available. CRC cards are small on purpose, so you can't write much on them. This forces you to keep breaking down each component into smaller components and eventually, classes that are small enough to be individually described on index cards. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've learned about CRC cards, let's use them to design our bank machine system. Let us begin with a basic user component. In this example, our primary user would be a *Bank Customer* that would go on our first CRC card. We place bank customer in the class name section. The bank customer's responsibilities are *insert a bank card* or *choose an operation*, such as *deposit*, *withdraw* or *check account balance*. Let's list these in the responsibility section of the CRC card. I'd go with *insert bank card* and *choose operation*, but write a description that makes sense for you. All of these bank customer responsibilities involve a *bank machine*. The customer can insert bank card in the machine and choose an operation. Since the bank machine is required for our bank customer component to fulfill its task, we placed *bank machine* under the *collaborators* section of the bank customer card. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/crc_customer.svg\" width=\"25%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's do the other component, the *bank machine* on another CRC card. We write *Bank Machine* in the class name section. The machine's responsibilities include *authenticate bank customer*, *display task options*, *deposit, withdraw and check balances*. And since this card interacts with the bank customer component, add *Bank Customer* to the collaborators section of the bank machine card. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/crc_machine.svg\" width=\"40%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have said, a key advantage of using CRC cards is that it allows you to physically reorganize your design. You can move related cards together or situate cards to suggest relationships. With our CRC cards, we can organize things by placing collaborating components together. For example, put the bank customer CRC card on the left and the bank machine CRC card on the right. Where CRC cards organized, you can simulate a prototype design of the system so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/crc_both.svg\" width=\"70%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's consider the scenario of the bank machine authenticating our bank customer. You can imagine enacting our bank customer's insert card responsibility. This in turn, collaborates with the bank machine and triggers its responsibility to authenticate the bank customer. Once authenticated, the bank machine enacts its responsibility to display the task options. Here is where CRC cards shine. They are cheap, editable and disposable, so you are encouraged to experiment and play with alternative designs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the simulation we just did, you might ask, how does a bank machine authenticate the bank customer? This question suggests adding another component, the *Bank*, where the *Bank Machine* communicates to authenticate the *Bank Customer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/crc_bank.svg\" width=\"30%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you should understand how working with CRC cards can help to identify needed components in the design. You can find more candidate components by using CRC cards to prototype and simulate various scenarios. For instance, since the bank machine will talk over a network to the bank, you can add a *Network* CRC card between them. You want the network communication to be secure, so you make the network collaborate with a new component called *Encryption*. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/crc_full.svg\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This component supports secure communication with the bank. As well, you probably notice the bank machine itself contains several different components, which seem small enough to be individual classes for programming. For example, there's a *card reader*, *keypad*, *display*, *cheque slot* and *cash dispenser*. Each of these classes but their responsibilities and collaborators can be described on their own cards. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a design meeting with the software development team, you can have all the cards on the table and discuss a simulation of how these classes work with other classes to achieve their responsibilities. As before, these simulations may reveal shortcomings in the design and you can experiment with alternatives by introducing appropriate cards. \n",
