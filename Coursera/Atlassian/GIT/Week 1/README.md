# Our First Repository

This module gets you started using Git. It provides the foundation for the rest of the course. You will install Git and/or Sourcetree, create a local repository, create a commit, create a remote repository and push commits to a remote repository. You have the option of doing the hands-on labs using the Sourcetree graphical Git client and/or using a command line.
