    "DevOps has a few fundamental principles that most modern software projects follow. One of the key principles is to continuously **plan**, **build** and **release** small improvements to your product. This is contrasted with what might be called the *waterfall* approach, in which many features are **planned**, **developed** and **released** as one batch. Continuous small changes to a product, also known as small batch sizes leads to continuous improvement. For example, the image below shows a product with a single bug (a), while in (b) the single bug is removed. Even though the change is small these are different versions of the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/cellphones_error.svg\" width=\"50%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Small batch size also applies to features. For example, consider that the version of the product in (a) contains only blue icons. The product in (b) adds a single feature, the ability to have multicolor icons. \n",
    "Let's say that our project is an application that currently contains 50 files of code and we want to continuously improve this project. Git can help to do that, since it manages versions of products forming a project history. Each version of a project is called a *commit*. In the image below, the first version of the project is represented by commit A and contains a bug. The second version of the project is represented by commit B which differs from commit A only in that the bug has been fixed. Assuming the bug fix involves a change to only one of the 50 files, Commits A and B only differ by that single file. This is how small improvements can continuously be made to the product. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/bug_commit.svg\" width=\"50%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Git, each commit is a snapshot of the entire project at a given point in time. However, Git is very efficient at storing commits, where each unique file is stored only once. For example, after commit A, Git has stored 50 files. Commit B only adds one file for Git to store, the file that contains the bug fix. So after commit B, there are a total of 51 files stored. The collection of commits contains the *history* of the project. At any time you can review the projects history and undo changes by going back to the previous version of the project. For example, a commit A is the version of the product with only blue icons and a commit B adds the multicolor icon feature to the product. Let's say that customers don't like that feature for some reason, then, you can easily go back to a version of the product without the feature by either by going back to commit A, or by adding a new commit that undoes the work of commit B. \n",
    "\n",
    "All commits belong to a **branch**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> A branch can be thought of as an independent line of development of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, there is a single branch and it's called *master*. In the image below, commits A, B, and C all belong to the master branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/branches_master.svg\" width=\"40%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we want to maintain a stable project at the same time that we are working on it, we can create a separate branch and work on it independently of the *master* branch. In the image below, a *featureX* branch was created, and commit C includes content that is unique to the *featureX* branch. In this case, the master branch does not know that the *featureX* branch exists. The *master* branch thinks that the latest commit is B, even though separate work has been done on commit C. We've seen that branches can be used to independently work on the project without disrupting the rest of the project. Here the *master* branch sees the project as 50 stable files. This commit has usually been tested, approved and maybe the version of the product that is currently in production. The *featureX* branch sees the same 50 files plus maybe one file that was added for the new feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/branches_featureX.svg\" width=\"40%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The independence of branches allow teams to scale their work. For example, the project can be in production at commit B and separate development can be done on other brances, such as *featureX*, *bugY*, and *featureZ*. Commit B on the master branch is not aware of or impacted by the other branches. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a branch is ready to become part of the master branch, it can be merged into the master branch. A **merge** combines the work of separate branches. The image below shows that *featureX* is implemented on its own branch, which is also called *featureX*. Before the merge, the *master* branch has no knowledge of the *featureX* branch. After the merge, there's a single *master* branch with the latest commit, including the code that implements *featureX*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/merge_branches.svg\" width=\"60%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A **pull request** is a request to merge your branch into another branch. This request is usually made by developer of the branch when the feature, bug fix or other change is complete. In this example, the pull request is a request to merge the commit that includes *featureX* into the *master* branch. During a pull request team members can discuss, review, and approve your changes. You can also require that automated test pass before the merge is allowed to happen. This helps ensure that the changes introduced by the merge don't cause problems for the customer. If the pull request is accepted, your version of the project is merged and becomes the latest commit on the master branch. You can feel good about the quality because the changes were reviewed and automated tests have passed."

    "## Git Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of **version control** from the perspectives of content, teams, and agility. **Version control** manages a collection of changing and improving files which we can call a project. The complete history of the project is tracked and available at any time. It also supports teams working on that collection of files. Teams work in many different ways, and a good version control system will support many of their workflows or ways of getting work done. **Version control** helps support collaboration on the project and improves quality through facilitating team communication and reviews. Finally, it enables agility, the ability to adapt quickly and constructively to a changing environment. It does this by managing small changes to a project and by allowing you to easily test, fix or undo any ideas and changes that the team makes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most version control systems don't care about the type of content that is managed. Any content that you want to continuously improve is a good candidate for version control. Git is commonly used for managing the source code related to software projects. Git is especially good at managing text-based content like this. Code that is used to run tests is also a good candidate for version control. The tests need to be properly managed and are usually always improving. Version control is not limited to developer related projects. IT teams should manage configuration information in version control as well so that the infrastructure can be properly managed and rebuilt at any time. Documentation, books and websites all contain content that is consistently changing and improving, making them great candidates for version control as well. Any content that you want to properly manage and continuously improve should be managed with version control. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **distributed version control system** is a type of version control system. In this system, each user has a local copy of the complete history of the project, which is known as a *repository*. The image below shows that there are two users on the team and each has a copy of a remote repository on their local computer. Even though repositories are distributed among team members there's also a single remote repository that is designated as the source of truth or official state of the project. This repository is usually hosted in a data center or in the cloud. Another characteristic of Distributed Version Control is that because each user has a local copy of the complete history of the project, they can continue to work while offline. Finally, content is synchronized between repositories by pulling content from or pushing content to a remote repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/repositories.svg\" width=\"60%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that is free and open source software project meaning that the code that implements Git is publically available. No single company owns Git, and anyone can make contributions to improve it. Git has a vibrant community of support and an ecosystem in which many other technologies are integrated with it. Git adapts well to many types of projects and work flows. This means that whatever your project is or however your team likes to work together, Git can be adapted as a useful tool for your team. Git has been used successfully for very small projects and for very large projects. In fact software development of the Linux operating system is managed using Git. A Git repository contains a series of snapshots of the project over time which are known as commits. Each commit contains all of the directories and files of the project at the time the snapshot was taken. You can go back and view the project at earlier points by viewing the older commits. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, the repository holds three commits. In the first commit a file named `file.txt` was added to the repository, beginning the process of tracking this very simple project. In commit 2 a directory, or folder named `img` was added along with an image named `image.png`. The original `file.txt` file is also included in commit 2, maintaining a complete snapshot of the project. In commit 3, the `file.txt` file was modified. You can think of that as version 2 of the file. The project at commit 3 therefore contains a modified `file.txt` file and the `image.png` file. Notice that the project has gone through a series of continuous improvements with the help of Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/commits.svg\" width=\"40%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For interfacing with Git, we have the command line interface and the graphical user interface. The command line skills are assumed for most modern developer and IT jobs. Using command line also allows automate everything that can be automated, besides being easier and faster. On the other hand, graphical user interfaces, such as SourceTree, make some tasks easier than with command line. This is especially true when displaying information visually or when working with interactive Git commands such as interactive rebates. It is generally easier to user git periodically with SourceTree than with the command line, because the user interface guides you through more of the tasks."

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ git --version \n",
    "``` \n",
    "If no version information is shown, you must install Git. The Command Line Interface is also known as the CLI, the command line or the terminal - those terms are often used interchangeably. If Git is not installed on the computer, we can follow the [Atlassian tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git).\n",

    "$ git help [command]                    # git help init\n",

    "$ git status\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the command can be any number of flags which start either with a single dash or with double dashes. In this example the short flag is used to only provide critical status information. Note that flags are sometimes referred to as options or switches. The final section of a git command contains zero or more arguments. For example some commands accept file names as arguments such as the `git add` command.\n",
    "There are many ways to get help with Git. For example, online searches on any topic are usually successful. As far as within Git itself, you can type, `git help` followed by a command name for detailed help. This is the same as the [online documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/). You can also type `git help` or `git` alone to bring up overall git help. Concise help can usually be found the `-h` flag for a command. For example, we can call the help for the init command using\n",

    "A dash or a double dash is used to set a flag for a command. These are also known as options or switches. A vertical bar represents *or*. For example, `-p|--patch` can be specified as a flag. Optional values are surrounded by square brackets. Placeholders are surrounded by angled brackets, replace the placeholder with an actual value. Angled brackets surrounded by square brackets represents an optional placeholder. If you use this part of the command, you must replace the placeholder with an actual value. Parentheses are used for grouping. These are used for clarity or to disambiguate the command. For example, either the `-p` or `--patch` option must be set for the command. Two stand alone dashes are used to disambiguate the command. For example, to clarify you are specifying a path here, you can precede it with two stand alone dashes. Notice that in this example, the dashes are optional. Finally, three dots are used to specify that multiple occurrences are possible. For example, zero or more paths can be specified.

    "It's important to set your correct username and email address in Git. This information is included in any commit that you make to the repository. You use the `git config` command to specify or read configuration information. The system flag means the configuration setting applies to every repository for every user on your computer. The `global` flag applies to every repository that you, as a specific user, use on your computer. You can see that the `global` flag is used to set the *user name* and *email* in the example below.\n",

If a global value is not set, the system value takes precedence. \n",

    "There are two fundamental ways to start working with a remote repository, it depends on if you already have a local repository, *i.e.*, if depends on if you already have some work done via commits in a local repository that you want to push to a remote repository. If you do not have an existing local repository, then you will clone the remote repository, creating a local repository that is associated with the remote repository. If you already have a local repository with commits that you want to push to a remote repository, then you will add the remote repository to your local repository. \n",

    "### Cloning a remote repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Git clones a remote repository and creates its local copy using the `git clone`command. The word clone can be used as a noun and a verb. As a noun, a clone is a local copy of a remote repository. As a verb, cloning is the process of creating a clone. Once you have cloned a repository, you can work with the local repository optionally pushing your commits to and pulling new commits from the remote repository. A reference to the remote repository is included in the local repository. This allows you to synchronize the repositories. The project page of a Git hosting provider provides the `git clone` command and/or the remote repository URL for you to copy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `git clone` command is used to clone a remote repository, where you can copy the command or the URL from a git hosting provider. If you specify a local project name, that will be used as the name of the project directory. If you do not specify a local project name, then the project name in the URL minus the `.git` will be used as the name of the project directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we clone a repository hosted on Bitbucket named `helloworld`. Since we didn't specify a local project name this will create a `helloworld` project directory inside of the repository directory. Executing the command shows that a repository has been cloned in the `helloworld` directory, the commits on the remote repository are now in your local repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "# git clone <url/to/projectname.git> [local_project_name]\n",
    "$ git clone git@bitbucket.org:rogergranada/helloworld.git\n",
    "\n",
    "  Cloning into 'helloworld'...\n",

    "  remote: Total 35 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)\n",
    "  Unpacking objects: 100% (35/35), done\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing a git clone, information on the remote repository is always available using the `git remote` command. This command displays information about remote repositories associated with the local repository. For example, showing the remote information for the `helloworld` project, diplays (`--verbose` flag gets more detailed information):\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ git remote --verbose\n",
    "\n",
    "  origin https://bitbucket.org/rogergranada/helloworld.git (fetch)\n",
    "  origin https://bitbucket.org/rogergranada/helloworld.git (push)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Git responds with information on the remote repository. The URL that was used to clone the remote repository is shown. Instead of including that URL in git commands, you can use the alias named `origin`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding a remote repository to an existing local repository\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, we have commits in a local repository and we want to add an association to a remote repository so that we can synchronize them. If we already have a local repository with commits that we want to push to a remote repository, we can use the `git remote add` command. This command adds information about the remote repository to the local repository. The two repositories can then be synchronized using aliases instead of URL's. For example, let's say that we have an existing local repository named `repoa`, containing commits that we would like to push to a remote repository. We can log into Bitbucket and create a remote repository named `repoa`. Then from our existing local repository, we execute the `git remote add` command. In this example, we name our remote repository `origin` and we specify the URL copied from Bitbucket. Now, when we execute `git remote --verbose`, we can see that the Bitbucket URL is associated with an alias named origin. Finally, we can push commits from a local repository to the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:rogergranada/helloworld.git\n",
    "$ git remote --verbose\n",
    "\n",
    "  origin https://bitbucket.org/rogergranada/helloworld.git (fetch)\n",
    "  origin https://bitbucket.org/rogergranada/helloworld.git (push)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For writing the commits of a branch from the local repository to the remote repository, we use the `git push`command. A successful push synchronizes the branches on the local and remote repositories so that they contain exactly the same commits. Pushing to the remote repository is primarily done to share your work with the team, but it also serves as a good back up of the local repository.\n",
    "You execute the `git push` command to push commits from the local repository to the remote repository. The first time you push, you should pass the repository shortcut name or URL - the shortcut name is often origin. You should also include the branch name that you would like to push. The `--set-upstream`, or `-u` option, is used to set up a tracking relationship between your local branch and the corresponding remote branch. Git can then inform you when the branches are out of synch. The values after git push are all optional, because git will assume default information or use previous values after you've executed the first push.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the example below, we execute the `git push` command. We specify the `-u` flag the first time to set up a tracking relationship between the local and remote branches. We are pushing to the remote repository named origin, and the branch that we are pushing is called master. The commits from the local master branch are then written to the remote master branch. Because there is only one branch on both repositories, the repositories are now synchronized. Notice that after writing the objects to the remote repository, Git informs you that a tracking relationship has been set up between the local and remote branches because you specified the `-u` flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "#$ git push [-u] [<repository>] [<branch>]\n",
    "$ git push origin master\n",

    "  * [new branch]      master -> master\n",
