    "## Git's Graph Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph model defines the relationship among the commits in a repository. We will start by introducing a Directed Acyclic Graph. A graph is a way to model connected things. The actual connected things can be anything. For example, you can use a graph to model your family history or the directories and files on your computer. Graphs contain nodes connected by lines. The lines are technically called edges. Here's a graph containing three nodes and two edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/graphs.svg\" width=\"70%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The nodes represent the things that are being modeled, and the lines represent the connections between them. A directed graph means that the nodes are connected in a certain direction. The direction is represented using arrows. In the image above, we see a directed graph with three nodes and two edges. The nodes are connected with a direction pointing to the right. The arrow direction in a directed graph depends on how you define the relationship between the nodes. For example, let's say that these three nodes represent your grandparent, your parent, and you. In the image below, we can see the two directions of the graph as \"Point to your child\" and \"Point to your parent\". \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/directed_graph.svg\" width=\"70%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So the arrow direction in a directed graph depends on how you define the relationship between the nodes. In graphs, *acyclic* means no cycles or non-circular, *i.e.*, you cannot find a path where you start and finish on the same node. The graph on the left is acyclic because you start on node `A`, move to node `B`, then move to node `C`. There is no way to go back to node `A`, once you start. The graph on the right is cyclic because you can start an end on node `A`, simply by going around the circle clockwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/acyclic_cyclic.svg\" width=\"70%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A directed acyclic graph combines the concepts that we just talked about. It contains nodes connected with arrows and has no circular paths. The graph shown here is an example of a directed acyclic graph. It has nodes connected with arrows and you cannot find a path where you start and finish on the same node. \n",
    "\n",
    "Git models the relationship of commits with the directed acyclic graph. The entire graph contains a project's history, where each node in Git represents a commit. The arrows point at a commit's parents. In the example below, you can see that commit `A` has two parents, commit `B` and commit `B`. The commits and the relationship between them is what forms the project's history. A branch occurs if a commit has more than one child. This graph contains a branch because commit `A` has two children, commit `B` and commit `B`. A merge occurs when a commit has more than one parent. In this example, commit `D` is a merge of branch one and branch two. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/dag.svg\" width=\"35%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use Git clients, you will often see the commit graph. Here, we see the commit graph in source tree. This commit history contains a branch and a merge. The most recent commit is at the top. Notice that the graph does not have arrows. The arrows are implied by the vertical order of the commits. Using a command line, the `git log` command with the graph option shows you this diagram. You might find that graphical clients like source tree are helpful if you want to view complex Git graphs, but the command line also works.\n",

    "## Git IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, Git uses objects to store four types of things. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A **commit object** is a simple text file that contains information such as the *commit user information*, *commit message*, a *reference to the commit's parent or parents*, and a *reference to the root tree* of the project. That information is all that Git needs to rebuild the full contents of a commit. \n",
    "- An **annotated tag** is a reference to a specific commit. \n",
    "- A **tree** is an object that contains a list of the filenames and directories inside of a directory. \n",
    "- A **blob** is an object that stores the content of a file that is being managed by Git. \n",
    "\n",
    "A typical Git user may only interact with *commit objects* and *tags*, letting Git worry about the details related to *trees* and *blobs*. Git keeps these objects internally in something called the object store, but you typically don't directly interact with the object store. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **Git ID** is the name of a Git object. All the objects stored by Git are named with a 40-character hexadecimal string. These strings are commonly known as *Git IDs*, but they are also known as *object IDs*, *SHA-1s*, *hashes* and *checksums*. You commonly see these *Git IDs* as you work with Git. For example, the Git log command will show 40-character commit IDs like what we see below. \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ git log \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That string is the name of a commit object. *Git IDs* are what's known as *secure hash algorithm* one or *SHA-1* values. The 40-character hexadecimal string is the result of a mathematical computation based on the content. Statistically speaking, the SHA-1 value is unique for a given piece of content. The exact same content will always result in the same SHA-1 value, but it is virtually impossible to find two different content files that produce the same SHA-1 value. SHA-1 values are designed to avalanche, *i.e.*, small changes in the content, leads to a large difference in the SHA-1 values. To see this, the SHA-1 of the simple string `hi`, starts with `49f6`. The SHA-1 of the same string with a trailing space `hi ` starts with `6334`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that even very similar content leads to drastically different SHA-1 values. The `git hash-object <file>` command can be used to create SHA-1 values from file contents. You probably won't use this command very often, but Git uses it behind the scenes to create Git IDs. First, we create a file named `fileA.txt` containing the string `hi`. We then execute the Git hash-object command, passing in `fileA.txt`. You can see that Git returns the SHA-1 of the file contents. We can execute the same command on the same file and Git will return the same SHA-1 value. The string `hi` will always return this SHA-1. Now, we can change `fileA.txt` contents to `hi ` (with a trailing space). Executing Git hash-object again, will create a drastically different SHA-1. This is the avalanching behavior that we just talked about. Small changes in content lead to large changes in SHA-1 values. \n",

    "Git hash-object is an example of a low level or [plumbing command](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain) in Git. You probably will not commonly use plumbing commands, but they're useful for scripting and can be useful for helping you to understand Git. Since the 40-character Git ID names are not very people friendly, Git sometimes shortens them to the first seven characters. Here you can see that the Git log command with the one line option returns a shortened Git ID for the commit object. \n",

Notice that the first seven characters match the shortened version of the Git ID. When you are entering IDs in Git commands, you can shorten the IDs too, just to use at least the first four characters when referencing an ID. If there is only one object in the object store that starts with those characters, Git will know which object you are referring to. In rare cases, two objects may start with similar characters and you may need to enter more characters of the ID in order for Git to unambiguously identify the object. In the example below, we use the `git show` command, which shows the contents of an object. Here, we include only the first four characters of the Git ID. Git knows which object you are referring to and returns information on the object. \n",

If we never create a branch in a repository, then by default, all commits are part of the `master` branch. Here, we execute the `git status` command. And Git informs us that we are currently on the master branch. Any commits that we would make at this point would be to this branch.\n",

    "A branch label points to the most recent commit in the branch. That commit is commonly called the \"tip of the branch\". Branch labels are implemented as references. In this example there are three commits on the master branch, with the master branch label pointing to the tip of the branch. Note the subtle difference between a branch and a branch label. All three commits belong to the master branch, even though the master branch label is only at the tip of the branch. Since a branch in Git is implemented as a tiny branch label, branches are extremely simple to implement and use very few resources.\n",

    "We mentioned that Git implements branch labels as references. These references are stored in the `.git` directory of the local repository. Just so that we can understand them better, let's take a look inside the `.git` directory and view a branch label reference. This is not a common thing to do and Git might actually optimize the directory by what is known as packing. This can change the location of the reference, so it's best not to directly work inside of this directory. Let's start by changing from the project directory to the `.git` directory. Listing the contents of the `.git` directory shows that it contains a `refs` directory. References are stored in this directory. We change to the `refs` directory. Listing the contents of this directory shows that it contains a `heads` directory and a `tags` directory. Local branch references are in the `heads` directory. We change to the `heads` directory. Listing the contents of the `heads` directory shows that there's currently just one branch label reference named `master`. It's the name of the default branch in the repository. Master is a reference which is implemented as a simple text file. If we view the contents of the master reference, we can see that it contains a SHA-1 hash. This is the SHA-1 of the commit object at the tip of the branch. This is how Git makes the association between the master branch label reference and the SHA-1 hash of the tip of the branch. Notice that reference files are tiny, containing only a short string. `HEAD` is a reference to the current commit. It usually points to the branch label of the current branch. Because it only points to the current commit and there can only be one current commit, there is only one `HEAD` reference in your local repository.\n",

    "All commits of a project belong to a branch. By default, commit belong to the `master` branch. A branch is a set of commits starting with the most recent commit in the branch and tracing back to the project's first commit. In the example below, starting from the most recent commit on the branch, the master branch contains commits `B` and `A`. The `featureX` branch contains commits `C`, `B` and `A`. Notice that commits `B` and `A` belong to both branches. \n",

    "### Listing and Creating Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at some of the benefits of branches. We will see that **creating a branch is fast and easy**, since a branch only creates one tiny file, a reference. Branches **enable experimentation**. Team members can isolate their work so that it doesn't impact others until the work is ready. Branches are not aware of other branches. This allows you to experiment with changes to the project, while at the same time the team retains a stable version of the project. If you have an idea for a change, you can create a branch and test your idea. Later you can throw out your branch, or merge it into the official project. Branches **enable multiple team members** to concurrently work on the project, without stepping on each other's work. Merging the work together later usually is not too difficult. Branches allow you to **support multiple versions** of the project simultaneously. For example, if the project is a software project with customers on several supported versions, you can update each version if an important hot fix is necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Branches can be **short lived** or **long running**. **Short lived** branches are commonly called topic or feature branches, and usually contain one small change to the project. For example, a topic branch may contain a new feature, a bug fix, a hot fix, a configuration change, or any other change that the project requires. When it's ready, a topic branch is merged into a long running branch. In the example below, the `featureX` branch is a topic branch. Two commits were needed to create the feature, and then the feature was merged into the master branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/short_lived.svg\" width=\"90%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long running** branches like the master branch live longer than topic branches, and can even live for the life of the project. Examples of branches that might live for the life of a project are a `master` branch or a `develop` branch. We will see later that git branches are flexible enough to work with many types of workflows. So you can pick a branching strategy that works best for your team and for your project. Use the `git branch` command to see a list of branches in the local repository. The branch that you are currently on has an asterisk. You can see here that there are two branches in the local repository, and the current branch is the `master` branch.\n",

First, it switches the current commit which is the commit that the `HEAD` reference points to, to the checked out branch label or commit.

You can then use the `git checkout` command to checkout the `featureX` branch. These two commands in combination create and switch to the `featureX` branch. To combine creating and checking out a branch into a single command, use the `-b` option with `git checkout`. This combines the `git branch` and the `git checkout` commands. This command is only for new branches. It fails if the branch already exists. \n",

The `HEAD` reference moves along with the `featureX` label, and the `master` label stays where it was. The `master` branch no longer points to the latest commit. In fact, the master branch doesn't know about the `featureX` branch label, or about the latest commit on `featureX`.

This means that instead of the `HEAD` reference pointing to a branch label, `HEAD` points directly to the SHA-1 of a commit. So a detached `HEAD` basically means that the `HEAD` reference is detached from a branch label. Git will warn you that if you continue you will be in a detached `HEAD` state. In the example below, in the before state, we have the `master` branch checked out as is normal. If we then checkout the previous commit, that commit will become the current commit, and the `HEAD` reference will point directly at that commit, creating a detached `HEAD` state. \n",

If we want to create commits based off of that commit, we should first create a `featureX` branch label, and checkout that branch. That puts us back in the normal state where the `HEAD` reference points to a branch label. The next commit will then be made to the `featureX` branch. \n",

This shows how truly lightweight git branches are. Use the `-d` option on the `git branch` command to delete a branch. For example, we start with two branches, but use the `-d` option, to delete the `featureX` branch. A call to `git branch` shows that the `featureX` branch has been deleted. Branch labels are commonly deleted after a topic branch has been merged. \n",

Let's say that you created a `featureX` branch off of commit `C` of the master branch as shown below. Then you did some work on `featureX` and made commit `D`. At that point, if you tried to delete the `featureX` branch label, there would be a problem because commit `D` does not belong to any other branch. \n",

    "Git normally will not let you do that. Here we tried to delete the `featureX` branch label. You can see that it responds by saying that the branch is not fully merged. This means that you could lose some commits that would not belong to any branch. Git tells you what you can do to really delete the branch label, which is to specify the `-D` option with git branch. \n",

    "Let's say that we don't care about commit `D` and delete the `featureX` branch label using the `-D` option. The `featureX` label will be deleted, and you're left with a dangling Committee `D`. Commit `D` doesn't belong to any branch. Git will periodically garbage collect, looking for and deleting older dangling commits. So be careful if you use the `-D` option. It assumes that you want to throw away the work that's in the dangling commits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that you accidentally deleted a branch label, and you left some dangling commits. You can use a command  `git reflog` to undo that. Git reflog is a command that returns a local list of recent `HEAD` commits. This list is in the local `.git` directory, but not in the repository. So this only works locally. In this case, a dangling commit `D` can be found in the list of recent `HEAD` commits. Let's look at an example. Here let's say that we use the `-D` option of `git branch`, and deleted the `featureX` branch label. This left a dangling commit. You can actually see the SHA-1 of the dangling commit in the message returned by Git. Now we will use to `git reflog` to find that SHA-1. We execute to `git reflog` command, and what is returned is a list of the recent commits that `HEAD` pointed to. You can see that the second commit in this list, is the commit that added `featureX`. You can also see that the SHA-1 of this commit matches the SHA-1 that was displayed by get earlier. Since that commit object has not been deleted from the object store, we can copy that SHA-1, and call `git checkout` with the `-b` option, creating a `featureX` branch. \n",

    "## Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Merging** combines the work of independent branches. Usually, this involves merging a topic branch, such as the `featureX` branch, into what is called a base branch, such as the `master` branch. The base branch is usually a longer running branch than the topic branch. In the example below, the work of the two branches is combined into a single commit named `M`, which we will see later is called a merge commit. Prior to the merge, the master branch didn't know about the `featureX` branch. After the merge, the work of `featureX` is included in the `master` branch. Notice that after the merge commit, commit `B` is part of the `featureX` branch and the `master` branch. If we trace back from commit `M` to the initial commit, we can see that there's a path that includes commit `B`. If we trace the path of the `featureX` branch, we can see that it contains commits `B` and `A`. If we trace the two paths of commit `M`, we can see that all of the commits are included. In fact, we could color commit `B` half green since it belongs to both branches. For simplicity, we will keep the commits a single color, but keep in mind that a commit often belongs to more than one branch.\n",

    "- Rebase. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk about the first two now and the last two later. A **fast-forward merge** moves the base branch label to the tip of the topic branch. In the before example, on the left, we can see that we have a base branch called master and a topic branch called `featureX`. Commit `A` was made to the master branch and then a `featureX` branch was created. Commits `B` and `C` were created on the `featureX` branch. If at this point, the `featureX` branch is ready to be merged into the master branch, a fast-forward merge can be executed. As you see on the right, a fast-forward merge simply involves moving the master label from commit `A` to commit `C`. After the fast-forward merge, both branches contain exactly the same commits `C`, `B`, and `A`. All three commits are exactly the same as they were before the merge, only the master branch label was moved. The master branch now contains the work of `featureX` and the merge is complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fast_forward_merge.svg\" width=\"70%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A fast forward merge is possible only if no other commits have been made to the base branch since the topic branch was created. If any commits have been added to the base branch, it will not allow you to perform a fast-forward merge. In the example below, a fast-forward merge is not possible because commit `D` was created after the `featureX` branch was created. If Git had allowed a fast-forward merge, the master branch label would move to commit `C`, and the work of commit `D` would be bypassed. Whoever did the work of commit `D` would not be very happy with that, so the merge is not fast-forwardable.\n",

Then use the `git merge` command, specifying `featureX` as an argument. A fast-forward merge is the default way that Git will attempt the merge. Assuming the merge is successful, you can then delete the `featureX` branch label using the `-d` option of the `git branch` command. Thus, the steps are:\n",

Let's say that we are finished with `feature2` and are ready to merge with the master branch. The first thing we do is check out the `master` branch, the `feature2` branch will be merged into this branch. We then execute the `git merge` command, passing the `feature2` branch level as an argument. You can see that Git replied that this was a Fast-forward merge. Git will always try to perform a fast-forward merge unless you tell it not to. Now we can view our commit graph again, and see that the latest commit contains both the `master` and `feature2` labels. The fast-forward merge simply moved to the master branch label to the latest commit. We can then delete the `feature2` branch label using the `git branch` command with the `-d` option. One last view of the commit graph shows that we have a nice clean history with the `master` branch containing the work of `feature2`. \n",

    "As we have just seen, after a branch has been merged, its branch label can be deleted. This prevents a continuous increase in the number of merged branch labels as the project grows. Dealing with an ever increasing number of feature branch labels can be confusing. If you'd like to retain the knowledge of where the feature work occured, you can include this information in the feature's commit messages. Or you can add a tag that permanently marks the feature work. Even though we have deleted the merged branch label here, whether or not you should delete the branch label's after a merge is a decision that your team should make. We can see with a fast-forward merge, the resulting commit history is linear, there are no commits that have multiple parents. \n",

    "A **merge commit** combines the work of the tips of the feature and base branches and places the result into a single merge commit.

The commit `M` will include `featureX`, which is included in commit `C`, as well as anything else that is in commit `E`, the previous tip of the `master` branch. A merge commit always has multiple parents. We can see here that the commit `M` has two parents, commits `C` and `E`. Because of this non-linear commit graph, it's easy to see the branch in the commit history. Combining the work of multiple commits may result in what's called a merge conflict, if both branches change the same thing in different ways. \n",

In this example, before the merge, you have a `featureX` branch based off of commit `A` of the master branch. Two commits, `D` and `E`, were made to the `master` branch since the `featureX` branch label was created. Because the `master` branch has moved along since the `featureX` branch commit was created, this merge is not fast-forwardable. After the merge, you have a merge commit `M` containing a combination of the `featureX` branch and the latest master branch commit `E`. All of the commits shown then belong to the `master` branch, and you have a nonlinear commit graph. Like with fast-forward merges, the feature branch label can be deleted to prevent an ever increasing number of branch labels. In this case, the nonlinear commit graph clearly shows the branches and merges. \n",

For example, your team's policy might be to always merge feature branches using merge commits. This is so you can clearly see the branches in the commit graph. A no fast-forward merge means that a merge commit will always be created, even if the merge is fast-forwardable. The steps to perform a no fast-forward merge are similar to the steps for the other merges. The only exception is that you include the `--no-ff` option with the `git merge` command, this will always create a merge commit.

    "Different teams may have different policies on what to do with fast-forwardable merges, and with merges in general. They may require a linear history to keep things clean, they may require merge commits to clearly see the branch history. Or they may let the person doing the merging decide what to do. In addition to merging topic branches into long-running branches, some teams periodically merge long-running branches into other long-running branches. These merges are usually easy, because they are fast-forwardable, even if a merge commit is used. \n",
