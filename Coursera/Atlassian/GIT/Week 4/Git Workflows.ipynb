    "## Pull Requests I\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pull requests** are a feature of Git hosting sites such as Bitbucket and GitHub. The ultimate goal of a pull request is to **merge a branch into the project**. Pull requests enable team communication related to the work of the branch. Notifications, related to the pull request, can be sent to team members. Those team members can provide feedback or comments, and ultimately can approve the content - this can act as a form of code review. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic repository configurations related to pull requests. The first one is a **single remote repository**, where a pull request in a single repository configuration is a request to merge a branch of the repository. The second configuration involves **two remote repositories**. In this configuration, a pull request is a request to merge a branch from a forked repository into the upstream repository. The *fork* approach is common if the submitter does not have write access to the upstream repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/pull_request.svg\" width=\"50%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a pull request, which is also called *opening* a pull request, anytime during the life of the branch. You can open a pull request when you create the branch, which enables the team to begin discussion on the work of the branch immediately. You can also open a pull request when you want comments on the branch (*e.g.*, you may be stuck implementing something and want to ask the team for help). And finally, you can open the pull request when you think the branch is ready for review and merging. As you can see, a pull request can be opened at any time after the related branch is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make a pull request in a single repository, you first need to prepare to make the request. To prepare to make the pull request, first you create a feature branch. This is the branch that we hope will eventually be merged into a longer running branch. You can work on the future branch before opening a pull request, but to start the team discussion, you can also open a pull request immediately after creating the branch. You then push the branch to the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example of preparing for a pull request. We start by creating and checking out a branch named `featureX`, the `-b` option of the `git checkout` command creates the branch. Then, we do some work on the branch by creating a file named `fileA.txt`, we add the file to the staging area, we then commit the file. Finally, we will execute the `git push` command, pushing the `featureX` branch to the remote server. The `--set-upstream` option ensures that we set up a local tracking branch. When we execute the `git push` command, we can see a helpful message about creating a pull request for the branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ git checkout -b \"featureX\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  Switched to a new branch 'featureX'\n",
    "\n",
    "$ touch fileA.txt\n",
    "$ git add fileA.txt\n",
    "$ git commit -m 'added featureX'\n",
    "\n",
    "  [(featureX 52c3153)] added featureX\n",
    "    1 file changed, 0 inserctions(+), 0 deletions(-)\n",
    "    create mode 100644 fileA.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "$ git push --set-upstream origin featureX\n",

    "  Branch featureX set up to track remote branch featureX from origin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That bitbucket URL can be used to open a pull request directly from your browser. To open a pull request you can log into bitbucket, navigate to your remote repository and click on Pull requests. In Bitbucket, you are presented with a pull request form to fill out.\n",
    "You title your pull request, add a description of work done on the branch, optionally specify specific reviewers of the pull request,\n",
    "and then click *Create pull request*. When a pull request has been submitted to you, you will see the pull request in your *Bitbucket dashboard*, which is part of the *Overview* tab. When you are reviewing a pull request, you can see the full context of the request. You can review the information of the pull request itself, you can see what has change in the project, and you can see the comments that were made. This is where you can add your own comments. You can click *Approve* to add to the count of approvers of the pull request. Your project might require a certain number of approvals before the merge is allowed. A person doing the merging of the pull request can gain confidence depending on how many people approve it, and by who specifically approves it. Click *Decline* to reject or remove the pull request. Be careful if you do this because it cannot be undone. Click *Edit* to update the pull request, you do not need to do this if you add a commit\n",
    "to the branch, the pull request will automatically be updated. Click *Merge* to begin the process of merging the branch, remember that merging is the ultimate goal of the pull request. You will then be asked to select a merge strategy. You can create a merge commit or you can squash, a squash will reduce the entire branch to one linear commit. You don't have to use one of these strategies to perform the merge, you can use your local client to merge the branch just as usual. When you push the merge to the remote repository the pull request will be closed. After the merge, you can then delete the remote branch label.\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "$ git push -d origin featureX\n",
    "\n",
    "  To https://bitbucket.org/user/repoX.git\n",
    "    - [deleted]  featureX\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we execute `git push` with the `-d` option to delete the `featureX` branch label. Pull requests are opened using an online Git host such as Bitbucket of GitHub. The ultimate goal of a pull request is to merge a branch, but they also facilitate team discussion and approval. You can open a pull request any time after creating the branch, you do not need to edit the pull request if you add a commit to the branch. You can merge the pull request using an online Git host or by pushing the merge from your local client."

    "\n",
    "**Forking** generally means copying a remote repository to your own online account. It is a feature of get hosting services such a Bitbucket and GitHub. In the forking process, there are the *upstream repository* and the *fork*. Both repositories are remote repositories. The upstream repository is usually considered the source of truth for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/fork_repository.svg\" width=\"30%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A fork can be used for a number of reasons. It can be used to experiment with or learn from the upstream repository. You have a separate remote repository that can be synchronized with the upstream repository as the upstream repository changes. A fork can also be used to create branches and issue pull requests to the upstream repository. This is how you can contribute to the upstream project. A fork can also be used to create a different source of truth. In other words, it can be used to start a new line of development of the project that remains independent from the upstream repository. You could use the upstream project as a starting point for a different type project or you could create a source of truth that competes with the upstream project. This may or may not be a desirable thing to do. It maybe better to just help improve the upstream project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fork is a feature of a Git hosting service. For example, we log in to Bitbucket and navigate to the repository that we want to fork. In this case. We then click on the `Fork` this repository link and name the forked repository. We then click `Fork` repository. If commits are made on the upstream repository, by default the fork will not contain those commits. In the example, we are viewing our forked repository in the Bitbucket. There is a message saying that this fork is 1 commit behind the upstream repository. This means that since we last synchronized, a commit has been made to the upstream repository. To synchronize your repositories, you start by clicking the `Sync now` link. Synchronizing using Bitbucket creates a merge commit on the forked repository. This merge commit is not in the upstream repository. So even though the project files are synchronized, the commit histories of the two repositories differ. This behavior may be fine, depending on how you are using the fork. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like more control over the commit histories, you can manually sync the repositories using your local Git client. After sinking the fork, you can view the merge commit in Bitbucket. In your local client, you'll need to do a pull to see the merge commit and have the latest project files.\n",
    "\n",
    "A multi-repository pull request involves an upstream repository and a fork. To open a multi-repository pull request, you fork the upstream repository and create a branch on that fork. That branch will be the branch related to the pull request. When you are ready, you can open a pull request right from your fork. If the upstream owner decides to merge the pull request, they have two basic choices. The first is to use the Bitbucket interface to perform the merge. The second is to use a local client to add the forked repository as a remote and then perform and push the merge to the upstream repository."

    "\n",
    "A **workflow** defines how your team accomplishes work. Git is very flexible and can be tailored to many types of projects and teams. You can mix and match some of the workflow ideas described here. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **centralized workflow** uses a single branch to accomplish the work of the project. Even though this workflow is very simple, you still gain many of the benefits of git. Your team members can all work independently, and each has a local copy of the project history. In this example, the remote repository contains two commits. User `A` cloned, fetched, or pulled when the remote repository only had commit `A`. They then created commit `C`. To add commit `C` to the remote repository, this user would have to pull or fetch and merge before pushing commit `C`. User `B` currently has both commits from the remote repository and would be able to push to the remote repository with no problem. A down side of the centralized workflow is that you are not taking advantage of features related to branching, such as pull requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/centralized_workflow.svg\" width=\"80%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **feature branch workflow**, the work of the project is done in feature, or topic branches. The work is then merged into a longer running branch. This has been the workflow used throughout most of this course. The feature branch workflow uses a single remote repository. Team members create feature branches and can submit their work using pull requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/feature_branch_workflow.svg\" width=\"70%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **forking workflow** involves multiple remote repositories. One of the repositories is considered upstream from the other. The upstream repository is considered the source of truth for the project. Work is usually transferred from the remote repository to the upstream repository, via a pull request. One advantage of this workflow is that the user of the forked repository does not need to have right access to the upstream repository. This is because a user on the upstream repository merges the pull request. Because of this, the forking workflow is very common in open source projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forking a repository is a great way to work on a feature branch without sharing your branch. This provides a remote backup of your work, and\n",
    "allows you to safely rebase your local branch. A downside of this approach is that the two remote repositories can become out of sync. It's the responsibility of the forked repository to keep up to date with the upstream repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we have the upstream repository on the top right, the forked repository is on the down right. You can see that the forked repository created the `feature1` branch before commit `C` was added to the upstream repository. These remote repositories are now not synchronized. User `A` of the forked repository would have to synchronize the repository before they could submit a pull request with the `feature1` branch. This would involve merging or rebasing before making the pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/forking_workflow.svg\" width=\"70%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitFlow** is a workflow that allows safe continuous releases of the project. It allows work to continue even through releases and hotfixes. The commit graph shown below is an example in the spirit of a GitFlow workflow. The general ideas here are used in specific ways that depend on the team and the type of project. We will break the commit graph down step by step, where you can see that GitFlow projects involve a number of branches. In this diagram, the long running branch labels have solid borders and the short lived branch labels have dashed borders. You can see that the `master` and `developed` branches are the only long running branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/gitflow.svg\" width=\"80%\" align=\"center\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the `master` branch, you can see that there are three commits. Commit `A` is the initial commit in the repository. We will assume that any commits on the `master` branch after commit `A` represent a version of our project that customers can use. These releases have been tagged with version labels. This commit graph includes a release of `version 1` of the project, then shortly follows with a minor update. We are going to keep things simple and release `version 1` of the project with a single feature named `feature1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The initial commit of the project (commit `A`) is created on the `master` branch. It can be very simple, like a read me file. The develop branch is created off of the `master` branch. Commit `B` is the first commit on the `develop` branch. It too can be very simple. We have now created our two long running branches. Our first release of the project is planned to have only a single feature named `feature1`. We create a `feature1` branch, then get to work. Commit `C` begins the work of `feature1`. We then finish the work of `feature1` in commit `D`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the team decides that `feature1` is ready to be merged into the `develop` branch. This may have been done through a pull request. Merge commit `E` is created on the `develop` branch. At this point, the `develop` branch contains `feature1`. Since the `feature1` branch is merged, we can delete the `feature1` branch label. The team has decided that the first release will contain only a single feature, and that commit `E` represents a release candidate. A `release1` branch is created off of commit `E`. At this point, commits intended for `release1` can only be made on the `release1` branch. Any commits to the `develop` branch will be in a future release.\n",
    "\n",
    "The commits on the `release1` branch should mainly be for fixing issues with `release1`, not adding new features. Since the developer is done with `feature1` and knows of no issues with the release, they create a `feature2` branch and begin working on `feature2`. This work is for a later release of the project. Commit `F` contains some of the work of `feature2`. The team has discovered a bug in Commit `E`. Commit `G` is added to the `release1` branch. This commit fixes the bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as the team is concerned, commit `G` is ready for release to the `master` branch. Merge commit `H` is created. This contains `feature1`. Commit `H` is tagged with a `version 1.0` label so that team members can easily find released versions of the project. When you commit to the `master` branch in a GitFlow workflow, it's important to consider how that commit impacts other branches. Commit `G` should be merged into the `develop` branch, which we do here with commit `I`. If we didn't do this, the bug fix from commit `G` would not be in the `develop` branch. This means that the bug would come back in the next release.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we have merged the `release1` branch to both `master` and `develop`, we can now delete the `branch1` label. Release branches are only valid for a single release. Let's say that we are working away on `feature2`, and then then someone reports a bug with our `version 1` release. We create a `hotfix1` branch to deal with this problem and create commit `J` which fixes the bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not branch off of the develop branch because new commits could have been made to the `develop` branch for the next release. We don't want those features in our `hotfix`. We want to make the change to the release as small as we can to limit our risk while still fixing the bug. Hotfix commit `J` is then merged into `master` with commit `K`. This fixes the bug. We tag commit `K` with `version 1.01`. This represents the latest release of the project. Because we have committed to `master`, we need to also commit to the `develop` branch. Merge commit `L` is then created and sharing that the `hotfix` is also included in the `develop` branch. A `hotfix` branch is created for a single hotfix and once changes are merged to the `master` and `develop` branches, the `hotfix1` branch label can be deleted. At this point, we can continue work on `feature2` and any other work planned for the next release. This process continues indefinitely, allowing for a continuous improvement of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have used some rules with our GitFlow workflow. Teams may have different rules. One rule is to only use merge commits on `master`.\n",
    "You can see that, with the exception of Commit `A`, no work is done directly on `master`. Commits `H` and `K` are merge commits. You can tell that they are merge commits, because they have have multiple parents. Another rule is that the commits to `master` can only come from release or hotfix branches. You should not directly merge from the `develop` or `feature` branches. This helps ensure proper testing and quality for the release. You can see here that commit `H` merges in the `release1` branch and commit `K` merges in the `hotfix1` branch. The third rule is, if you commit to `master`, also merge into the `develop` branch. If you don't do this, issues that were fixed will reappear in future releases. You can see here that when we merged commit `G` into `master`, we also merged it into the `develop` branch with merge commit `I`. If we didn't do that, the bug fix in commit `G`, will not be in our future versions. Similarly, when we merged hotfix `J` into `master`, we also merged it into the `develop` branch in merge commit `L`."
