This folder contains codes to the [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning) course by Younes Bensouda Mourri and Lucasz Kaiser. According to the description presented in the web site:

> In Course 1 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, offered by deeplearning.ai, you will:
> 
> a) Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then naÃ¯ve Bayes, 
> b) Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and
> c) Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.
